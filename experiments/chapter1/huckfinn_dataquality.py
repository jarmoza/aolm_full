# Purpose: Measuring data quality for the Huckleberry Finn data set

# List of data quality metrics to consider

# 1. Consistency
# 2. Integrity

# Tasks

# 1. Come up with reasonable interpretations/metrics of consistency and integrity for the Huck Finn corpus
# 2. Understand the state of the Huck Finn corpus
# - Create a document where the folders/files of the Twain corpus are explained and their provenance properly cited
# 3. Consider how metrics will apply to either the raw data downloaded or the demarcated data
# - e.g. Maybe we would prefer to put some dq metrics over the raw data, and for others examining portions of the text
# itself to use the demarcated data
# 4. Consider metadata assessments as dq metrics

# Note: Demarcated data consists of texts that have been uniformly subdivided by using uniform headings
# i.e. Huck Finn being divided by the same chapter name so chapter text can undergo relevant dq metrics
