# Purpose: Measuring data quality for the Huckleberry Finn data set

# List of data quality metrics to consider

# 1. Consistency
# 2. Integrity

# Tasks

# 1. Come up with reasonable interpretations/metrics of consistency and integrity for the Huck Finn corpus
# 2. Understand the state of the Huck Finn corpus
# - Create a document where the folders/files of the Twain corpus are explained and their provenance properly cited
# 3. Consider how metrics will apply to either the raw data downloaded or the demarcated data
# - e.g. Maybe we would prefer to put some dq metrics over the raw data, and for others examining portions of the text
# itself to use the demarcated data
# 4. Consider metadata assessments as dq metrics

# Note: Demarcated data consists of texts that have been uniformly subdivided by using uniform headings
# i.e. Huck Finn being divided by the same chapter name so chapter text can undergo relevant dq metrics


# NOTE: Thoughts/hypotheses and then findings should be written up
# These writings can then be used as an experimental (scientific) means of tweaking the data quality
# metrics, how they are weighted in the data quality framework machine/script


### Experiment 1

# Metadata quality

# Hypothesis

### Experiment 2

# Text quality
# Let's re-read Sebastian Coleman and my notes for data quality metrics that would be applicable for the texts in the collection
# Then implement a few metrics using the text ingestion utility scripts already written

# Hypothesis: Texts should (1) Contain all chapters found in the ur copy (MTPO)
# and (2) be mostly identical internally chapter by chapter
