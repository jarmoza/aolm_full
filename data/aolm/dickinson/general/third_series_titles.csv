AURORA
How dare the robins sing,
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
THE TULIP
FORGOTTEN
ALPINE GLOW
The farthest thunder that I heard
On the bleakness of my lot
REMEMBRANCE
Poor little heart!
NATURE'S CHANGES
THE WIND
DEATH
THE COMING OF NIGHT
Each that we lose takes part of us;
This world is not conclusion;
I've got an arrow here;
A light exists in spring
WITH FLOWERS
Life, and Death, and Giants
EXPERIENCE
Is bliss, then, such abyss
I worked for chaff, and earning wheat
RETICENCE
THE WAKING YEAR
THE MASTER
AFTERMATH
UNWARNED
IMMORTALITY
We cover thee, sweet face.
Not with a club the heart is broken,
WEDDED
LOYALTY
CONTRAST
I have a king who does not speak;
DISENCHANTMENT
FRIENDS
To lose thee, sweeter than to gain
LONGING
We outgrow love like other things
ENDING
The distance that the dead have gone
SUNSET
They say that 'time assuages,'
They won't frown always,  some sweet day
DREAMS
Heart, we will forget him!
LOST JOY
A MAN
FIRE
LOST FAITH
Father, I bring thee not myself,
NUMEN LUMEN
That such have died enables us
We learn in the retreating
COCOON
RETROSPECT
Immortal is an ample word
So proud she was to die
I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
A PORTRAIT
Superfluous were the sun
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
ETERNITY
WAITING
THE SPIRIT
DYING
A WORD
SATURDAY AFTERNOON
Few get enough,  enough is one;
To venerate the simple days
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
THE MONUMENT
A sickness of this world it most occasions
SLEEPING
TRYING TO FORGET
The grave my little cottage is,
If the foolish call them 'flowers,'
Who has not found the heaven below
A BOOK
How still the bells in steeples stand,
Where every bird is bold to go,
I wish I knew that woman's name,
Far from love the Heavenly Father
This was in the white of the year,
I felt a funeral in my brain,
SUPERIORITY TO FATE
ASPIRATION
LIFE'S TRADES
Drowning is not so pitiful
THE INEVITABLE
HOPE
I meant to find her when I came;
Sweet hours have perished here;
Three weeks passed since I had seen her,
CHARLOTTE BRONT'S GRAVE.
A SYLLABLE
PARTING
A toad can die of light!
I breathed enough to learn the trick,
A clock stopped  not the mantel's;
The soul should always stand ajar,
INVISIBLE
REAL RICHES
Me! Come! My dazzled face
DEAD
THIRST
FAREWELL
There's been a death in the opposite house
I wonder if the sepulchre
JOY IN DEATH
We never know we go,  when we are going
The dying need but little, dear,
Before the ice is in the pools,
Water is taught by thirst;
THE LOST THOUGHT
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
THE SOUL'S STORM
If I may have it when it's dead
A murmur in the trees to note,
THE BAT
Given in marriage unto thee,
WHO?
SONG
What soft, cherubic creatures
To help our bleaker parts
WITH A FLOWER
He touched me, so I live to know
The stimulus, beyond the grave
THE MOON
DAWN
THE BALLOON
Morning is the place for dew,
The bone that has no marrow;
LOVE
VENTURES
GRIEFS
SATISFIED
THE PAST
To my quick ear the leaves conferred;
EVENING
Could I but ride indefinite,
A WELL
THE BRAIN
PHILOSOPHY
CHILDISH GRIEFS
THANKSGIVING DAY
DESIRE
To hang our head ostensibly,
COBWEBS
A SNAKE
Not any higher stands the grave
A ROSE
A dew sufficed itself
MARCH
CONSECRATION
POWER
A modest lot, a fame petite,
LOVE'S HUMILITY
TO MARCH
THE WOODPECKER
High from the earth I heard a bird;
ASLEEP
