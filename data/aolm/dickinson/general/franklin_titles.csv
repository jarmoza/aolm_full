Bees are black with gilt surcingles
Sunset that screens reveals
Dare you see a soul at the "White Heat"?
Though the great waters sleep
What mystery pervades a well!
She died - this was the way she died
Me come! My dazzled face
Better than music!
Like her the saints retire
The heart has many doors
No passenger was known to flee
Because that you are going
Could mortal lip divine
To her derided home
While we were fearing it, it came
There are two ripenings
Grief is a mouse
One blessing had I than the rest
How sick to wait in any place but thine
Few yet enough
Go slow, my soul, to feed thyself
The face in evanescence lain
"Remember me" implored the thief!
Glass was the street in tinsel peril
Conjecturing a climate
If what we could were what we would
The props assist the house
"Secrets" is a daily word
A route of evanescence
Each life converges to some centre
Each scar I'll keep for him
Further in summer than the birds
I went to heaven
Because he loves her
That this should feel the need of death
As if the sea should part
A precious mouldering pleasure 'tis
That is solemn we have ended
My wheel is in the dark!
Besides the autumn poets sing
Baffled for just a day or two
I see thee better in the dark
In rags mysterious as these
Glowing is her bonnet
It was given to me by the gods
This was in the white of the year
We lose because we win
We dream - it is good we are dreaming
An antiquated tree
His little hearse like figure
Sic transit gloria mundi
Whether my bark went down at sea
No romance sold unto
The products of my farm are these
To venerate the simple days
So glad we are a stranger'd deem
Herein a blossom lies
Safe in their alabaster chambers
Going to heaven!
Crisis is a hair
A bold, inspiriting bird is the jay
An antiquated grace
A coffin is a small domain
We play at paste
Pink - small - and punctual
Some keep the Sabbath going to church
While it is alive
A weight with needles on the pounds
Make me a picture of the sun
Most arrows slay but whom they strike
A face devoid of love or grace
Were nature mortal lady
Remembrance has a rear and front
Take all away from me but leave me ecstasy
Just so Jesus raps
A wind that rose though not a leaf
The farthest thunder that I heard
Least bee that brew a honey's weight
I felt a cleaving in my mind
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush
Rearrange a "wife's" affection!
I felt a cleaving in my mind
Why do they shut me out of heaven?
Not any higher stands the grave
In other motes
A wind that rose though not a leaf
Just so Christ raps
This that would greet an hour ago
Which misses most
Take all I have away
Remembrance has a rear and front
Some arrows slay but whom they strike
My life closed twice before it's close
A single screw of flesh
How many times these low feet staggered
The flower must not blame the bee
Dropped into the ether acre
Me change! Me alter!
Pink - small - and punctual
I'd rather recollect a setting
Such is the force of happiness
Under the light yet under
Going to heaven!
Too scanty 'twas to die for you
A night there lay the days between
I've got an arrow here
The dying need but little, dear
Safe in their alabaster chambers
What did they do since I saw them?
Sic transit gloria mundi
His little hearse like figure
No romance sold unto
Taken from men this morning
If ever the lid gets off my head
All these my banners be
This was in the white of the year
An antiquated tree
Glowing is her bonnet
I rose because he sank
I see thee better in the dark
I had some things that I called mine
Baffled for just a day or two
My wheel is in the dark!
These are the days when birds come back
The frost was never seen
They ask but our delight
I tried to think a lonelier thing
"Nature" is what we see
I went to heaven
Purple is fashionable twice
We introduce ourselves
A route of evanescence
Snow beneath whose chilly softness
Their hight in heaven comforts not
You've seen balloons set - hav'nt you?
Hope is a subtle glutton
Delight becomes pictorial
I measure every grief I meet
It came his turn to beg
"Remember me" implored the thief!
The face in evanescence lain
Mine by the right of the white election!
The mountains grow unnoticed
The vastest earthly day
Few yet enough
Our little secrets slink away
Let us play yesterday
It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
To her derided home
Could mortal lip divine
Because that you are going
No passenger was known to flee
The summer that we did not prize
At least to pray is left - is left
Like her the saints retire
"Sown in dishonor"!
It would never be common more - I said
What mystery pervades a well!
Though the great waters sleep
Sunset that screens reveals
They might not need me, yet they might
Dare you see a soul at the "White Heat"?
Though the great waters sleep
I never hear the word "Escape"
I have no life to live
I send you a decrepit flower
They might not need me, yet they might
We send the wave to find the wave
Will there really be a "morning"?
How spacious the wind must feel morns
The grass so little has to do
Do people moulder equally
'Twas such a little - little boat
The gentian has a parched corolla
There came a wind like a bugle
Life and death and giants
Pass to thy rendezvous of light
She laid her docile crescent down
I never hear that one is dead
No bobolink reverse his singing
The soul selects her own society
There are two ripenings
Ah, Teneriffe - receding mountain
Dear March - come in
The robin is a Gabriel
How soft a caterpillar steps
Did our best moment last
I could die to know
We thirst at first - 'tis nature's act
The one who could repeat the summer day
Life is what we make it
A route of evanescence
The riddle we can guess
To see the summer sky
A first mute coming
Two butterflies went out at noon
Finding is the first act
A not admitting of the wound
'Tis whiter than an Indian pipe
Because he loves her
She sped as petals of a rose
The soul unto itself
A charm invests a face
Heart! We will forget him!
Myself can read the telegrams
If she had been the mistletoe
Love thou art high
Many cross the Rhine
My friend attacks my friend!
I years had been from home
Sleep is supposed to be
The soul that hath a guest
We never know we go when we are going
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine
When I have seen the sun emerge
Drowning is not so pitiful
To him who keeps an orchis' heart
She's happy with a new content
Were it but me that gained the hight
As children bid the guest "Good night"
Death leaves us homesick, who behind
Mine enemy is growing old
A loss of something ever felt I
Safe in their alabaster chambers
My heart opon a little plate
A little madness in the spring
Escape is such a thankful word
I came to buy a smile today
What shall I do - it whimpers so
Savior! I've no one else to tell
While it is alive
The mushroom is the elf of plants
A slash of blue! A sweep of gray!
Take all I have away
Sweet hours have perished here
I play at riches to appease
'Twas here my summer paused
Parting with thee reluctantly
The harm of years is on him
I shall keep singing!
This dust and it's feature
Least bee that brew a honey's weight
It cant be "summer"!
I worked for chaff and earning wheat
The loneliness one dare not sound
A wind that rose though not a leaf
Forever at his side to walk
Wild nights - Wild nights!
Not any higher stands the grave
Expectation is contentment
Softened by time's consummate plush
Two were immortal twice
Apparently with no surprise
Take all I have away
Which misses most
My first well day since many ill
I should not dare to leave my friend
A bee his burnished carriage
What shall I do - it whimpers so
Father - I bring thee not myself
A clock stopped
Crisis is sweet and yet the heart
Pink - small - and punctual
Safe in their alabaster chambers
The hollows round his eager eyes
Mine enemy is growing old
Bloom is result - to meet a flower
Did we abolish frost
Ribbons of the year
I bring an unaccustomed wine
The stem of a departed flower
Some say good night at night
To lose if one can find again
I heard a fly buzz when I died
Sleep is supposed to be
We outgrow love like other things
We never know we go when we are going
A something in a summer's day
You'll find it when you try to die
Our journey had advanced
In lands I never saw - they say
If she had been the mistletoe
I am afraid to own a body
Once more my now bewildered dove
If I may have it when it's dead
It will not harm her magic pace
The angle of a landscape
She sped as petals from a rose
Because the bee may blameless hum
Two butterflies went out at noon
A counterfeit - a plated person
A great hope fell
Ferocious as a bee without a wing
The riddle that we guess
A thought went up my mind today
I could bring you jewels - had I a mind to
A route of evanescence
The one that could repeat the summer day
Precious to me she still shall be
Must be a wo
A dimple in the tomb
Trust in the unexpected
The robin is a troubadour
Ah, Teneriffe - receding mountain
There are two ripenings
The notice that is called the spring
Surprise is like a thrilling pungent
The soul selects her own society
The sunrise runs for both
Incredible the lodging
Pass to thy rendezvous of light
We wear our sober dresses when we die
Summer has two beginnings
Drama's vitallest expression is the common day
Knows how to forget!
"Sown in dishonor"!
How lonesome the wind must feel nights
Great Caesar! Condescend
The grass so little has to do
We send the wave to find the wave
They might not need me, yet they might
Wonder is not precisely knowing
What mystery pervades a well!
I never hear the word "Escape"
Though the great waters sleep
I cannot dance opon my toes
A little east of Jordan
If pain for peace prepares
No passenger was known to flee
The moon is distant from the sea
Who is it seeks my pillow nights
Without a smile - without a throe
Such are the inlets of the mind
To fight aloud is very brave
Whose pink career may have a close
Morning that comes but once
So much summer
She lay as if at play
The symptom of the gale
There's the Battle of Burgoyne
Your riches taught me poverty
Alter! When the hills do
Perhaps she does not go so far
This me that walks and works must die
The spirit lasts but in what mode
She laid her docile crescent down
Autumn overlooked my knitting
The test of love is death
I prayed, at first, a little girl
She dwelleth in the ground
One thing of it we borrow
It knew no lapse nor diminution
The road to Paradise is plain
Lest any doubt that we are glad that they were born today
The day came slow till five o'clock
Split the lark and you'll find the music
Experience is the angled road
The difference between despair
We talked with each other about each other
The riddle that we guess
One of the ones that Midas touched
The incidents of love
Have any like myself
The moon was but a chin of gold
So gay a flower
Artists wrestled here!
Dreams are well but waking's better
Could I do more for thee
What inn is this
Delayed till she had ceased to know
Noon is the hinge of day
Who robbed the woods
I years had been from home
Our lives are Swiss
This chasm, Sweet, opon my life
She could not live upon the past
Who saw no sunrise cannot say
It rises - passes - on our south
As plan for noon and plan for night
Besides the autumn poets sing
A faded boy in sallow clothes
On this wondrous sea
I never told the buried gold
I watched the moon around the house
Distrustful of the gentian
I'm sorry for the dead today
Nature rarer uses yellow
My country need not change her gown
I got so I could hear his name
A little madness in the spring
Bound a trouble
We dont cry - Tim and I
Let others show this Surry's grace
What tenements of clover
I think just how my shape will rise
Lift it - with the feathers
Fairer through fading as the day
It's hour with itself
Perhaps you think me stooping
Ah, moon and star!
Who goes to dine must take his feast
If blame be my side - forfeit me
How dare the robins sing
This bauble was preferred of bees
A letter is a joy of earth
Most arrows slay but whom they strike
The reticent volcano keeps
The farthest thunder that I heard
Upon the gallows hung a wretch
A plated life diversified
The distance that the dead have gone
A letter is a joy of earth
The popular heart is a cannon first
Ah, moon and star!
The color of a queen is this
What I see not I better see
Perhaps you think me stooping
My triumph lasted till the drums
Let me not mar that perfect dream
If he dissolve - then there is nothing more
Pink - small - and punctual
For this - accepted breath
A burdock twitched my gown
It sifts from leaden sieves
Bound a trouble
A little madness in the spring
You cannot put a fire out
Flees so the phantom meadow
My country need not change her gown
Nature rarer uses yellow
On this wondrous sea
All things swept sole away
When I hoped I feared
I never told the buried gold
So large my will
Safe in their alabaster chambers
Of consciousness, her awful mate
I do not care - why should I care
My best acquaintances are those
Our lives are Swiss
I had a daily bliss
I had been hungry all the years
I robbed the woods
Uncertain lease developes lustre
Delayed till she had ceased to know
I see thee better in the dark
Low at my problem bending
So from the mould
I died for beauty but was scarce
The moon was but a chin of gold
Opinion is a flitting thing
He is alive this morning
One of the ones that Midas touched
Each life converges to some centre
The difference between despair
'Twas awkward but it fitted me
Experiment escorts us last
We talked with each other about each other
God made no act without a cause
That distance was between us
The day came slow till five o'clock
The road to Paradise is plain
We shall find the cube of the rainbow
It knew no lapse nor diminution
She dwelleth in the ground
They dropped like flakes
If what we could were what we would
It sounded as if the air were running
Who "meddled" with the costly hearts
Bloom opon the mountain stated
This me that walks and works must die
Perhaps they do not go so far
While I was fearing it - it came
Bereavement in their death to feel
Your riches taught me poverty
Heaven is so far of the mind
Promise this - When you be dying
The butterfly's assumption gown
The auctioneer of parting
Bees are black with gilt surcingles
A lady red amid the hill
We shun because we prize her face
From his slim palace in the dust
Though the great waters sleep
One joy of so much anguish
If pain for peace prepares
Taking up the fair ideal
I cannot dance opon my toes
A little over Jordan
It dont sound so terrible quite as it did
Surgeons must be very careful
All overgrown by cunning moss
All the letters I could write
Lay this laurel on the one
Not knowing when herself may come
Though the great waters sleep
I have no life to live
Like some old fashioned miracle
A toad can die of light
A little road not made of man
Death's waylaying not the sharpest
Each that we lose takes part of us
Of life to own
My life had stood a loaded gun
More life went out when he went
Expanse cannot be lost
She laid her docile crescent down
Perhaps they do not go so far
Warm in her hand these accents lie
This me that walks and works must die
There's been a death in the opposite house
For largest woman's heart I knew
Could that sweet darkness where they dwell
A soft sea washed around the house
One thing of thee I covet
Because he loves her
I meant to have but modest needs
An hour is a sea
I'm saying every day
The day came slow till five o'clock
Absence disembodies - so does death
We like March - his shoes are purple
It stole along so stealthy
No matter now - Sweet
The poets light but lamps
Opon concluded lives
A route of evanescence
South winds jostle them
It would have starved a gnat
The outer from the inner
For each extatic instant
A day! Help! Help!
Some things that fly there be
"Arcturus" is his other name
Of silken speech and specious shoe
Safe in their alabaster chambers
I knew that I had gained
By such and such an offering
To die without the dying
The manner of it's death
Tho' my destiny be fustian
As the starved maelstrom laps the navies
Birthday of but a single pang
A sepal - petal - and a thorn
Of course I prayed
By chivalries as tiny
A prompt - executive bird is the jay
I watched the moon around the house
Oh give it motion - deck it sweet
I have a bird in spring
My first well day since many ill
He forgot and I remembered
What is "Paradise"
It sifts from leaden sieves
Dropped into the ether acre
That short potential stir
What tenements of clover
Further in summer than the birds
To be alive is power
I held a jewel in my fingers
Who goes to dine must take his feast
Talk not to me of summer trees
Some we see no more, tenements of wonder
Would you like summer? Taste of our's
The hallowing of pain
To lose thee sweeter than to gain
The farthest thunder that I heard
I cannot want it more
Take all I have away
Death is like the insect
Take all I have away
The grave my little cottage is
High from the earth I heard a bird
Step lightly on this narrow spot
The farthest thunder that I heard
Over the fence
Somehow myself survived the night
The sun in reining to the west
None can experience stint
To be alive is power
The bone that has no marrow
I'm nobody! Who are you?
You cannot take itself
Further in summer than the birds
Dropped into the ether acre
Escape is such a thankful word
It is easy to work when the soul is at play
It sifts from leaden sieves
A burdock clawed my gown
A slash of blue! A sweep of gray!
The soul that hath a guest
A bold, inspiriting bird is the jay
If I should die
I have a bird in spring
'Tis seasons since the dimpled war
Drowning is not so pitiful
We see comparatively
Frequently the woods are pink
When bells stop ringing - church begins
The hills in purple syllables
Before the ice is in the pools
The sun and moon must make their haste
"Mama" never forgets her birds
Safe in their alabaster chambers
A cloud withdrew from the sky
Far from love the Heavenly Father
Within my reach!
Talk with prudence to a beggar
Could live - did live
The Malay took the pearl
So from the mould
Low at my problem bending
They shut me up in prose
"Nature" is what we see
A route of evanescence
Time's wily chargers will not wait
I've none to tell me to but thee
Out of sight? What of that?
A doubt if it be us
Two butterflies went out at noon
White as an Indian pipe
Too happy time dissolves itself
I know lives I could miss
She sped as petals from a rose
Doom is the house without the door
Estranged from beauty none can be
Whatever it is she has tried it
Could that sweet darkness where they dwell
For largest woman's heart I knew
The black berry wears a thorn in his side
Adversity if it shall be
Recollect the face of me
It sounded as if the air were running
He laid his docile crescent down
Climbing to reach the costly hearts
How many schemes may die
Inconceivably solemn!
I had no time to hate
I think to live may be a bliss
Your riches taught me poverty
Arrows enamored of his heart
Because that you are going
I have no life but this
Though the great waters sleep
Like some old fashioned miracle
Not knowing when the dawn will come
Lay this laurel on the one
A science - so the savans say
All the letters I can write
I'll clutch and clutch
I have a king who does not speak
Summer we all have seen
Through the straight pass of suffering
March is the month of expectation
My reward for being was this
I'm the little "Heart's Ease"!
By a flower - by a letter
Long years apart can make no
It's thoughts and just one heart
Who has not found the heaven below
Not at home to callers
From us she wandered now a year
All I may if small
I'll send the feather from my hat!
The things we thought that we should do
This is the place they hoped before
Speech is a prank of parliament
Partake as doth the bee
A curious cloud surprised the sky
Like men and women shadows walk
The winters are so short
God made a little gentian
Summer is shorter than any one
Great streets of silence led away
What soft cherubic creatures
An ignorance a sunset
One note from one bird
A full fed rose on meals of tint
Good to hide and hear 'em hunt!
I sing to use the waiting
I thought the train would never come
In thy long paradise of light
Bliss is the sceptre of the child
Wolfe demanded during dying
Tried always and condemned by thee
Some too fragile for winter winds
I took my power in my hand
Nature sometimes sears a sapling
To make one's toilette after death
Pigmy seraphs gone astray
The blood is more showy than the breath
The feet of people walking home
Had I presumed to hope
So has a daisy vanished
The future never spoke
These are the signs to nature's inns
No autumn's interceptive chill
The sunset stopped on cottages
The Bible is an untold volume
Her little parasol to lift
The wind did'nt come from the orchard today
We'll pass without a parting
The largest fire ever known
He outstripped time with but a bout
That she forgot me was the least
A rat surrendered here
I shall know why when time is over
The rat is the concisest tenant
The sea said "Come" to the brook
Nature can do no more
Unto like story trouble has enticed me
After all birds have been investigated
My river runs to thee
An awful tempest mashed the air
You see I cannot see your lifetime
Did life's penurious length
Patience has a quiet outer
Of their peculiar light
The ditch is dear to the drunken man
The immortality she gave
"Faithful to the end" amended
The parasol is the umbrella's daughter
If your nerve deny you
Had I not this or this I said
As old as woe
The clover's simple fame
Conferring with myself
The luxury to apprehend
I felt a funeral in my brain
Fortitude incarnate
I like a look of agony
The luxury to apprehend
'Twas comfort in her dying room
All forgot for recollecting
Of tribulation these are they
A stagnant pleasure like a pool
"Faithful to the end" amended
Of glory not a beam is left
The waters chased him as he fled
Struck was I nor yet by lightning
God is indeed a jealous God
The ecstasy to guess
The butterfly's Numidian gown
I'm "wife" - I've finished that
"Hope" is the thing with feathers
One year ago jots what?
My river runs to thee
After all birds have been investigated
Down time's quaint stream
I cannot see my soul but know 'tis there
The rat is the concisest tenant
On this long storm the rainbow rose
This dirty little heart
A word made flesh is seldom
The largest fire ever known
Life is death we're lengthy at
One day is there of the series
The Bible is an antique volume
It is an honorable thought
The wind did'nt come from the orchard today
Where I am not afraid to go
I went to thank her
Morns like these we parted
No autumn's intercepting chill
Of the heart that goes in and closes the door
The butterfly upon the sky
I saw no way - The heavens were stitched
The feet of people walking home
'Tis good the looking back on grief
Pigmy seraphs gone astray
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower
She dealt her pretty words like blades
Some such butterfly be seen
Wolfe demanded during dying
Of death I try to think like this
Bliss is the plaything of the child
The good will of a flower
Paradise is that old mansion
The road was lit with moon and star
The lightning is a yellow fork
A moth the hue of this
There is a shame of nobleness
Go not too near a house of rose
Great streets of silence led away
Before you thought of spring
I could not prove the years had feet
It always felt to me a wrong
I reckon when I count at all
Like men and women shadows walk
Of Brussels it was not
'Tis anguish grander than delight
I know suspense - it steps so terse
Partake as doth the bee
The veins of other flowers
The things we thought that we should do
Victory comes late
No ladder needs the bird but skies
From us she wandered now a year
Who has not found the heaven below
Praise it - 'tis dead
I cant tell you, but you feel it
I know a place where summer strives
My reward for being was this
Ah, necromancy sweet!
March is the month of expectation
Through the straight pass of suffering
How fits his umber coat
Soto! Explore thyself!
The inundation of the spring
These held their wick above the west
They leave us with the infinite
It's thoughts and just one heart
I have never seen 'volcanoes'
'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!
It will be summer eventually
Not at home to callers
Dominion lasts until obtained
Candor - my tepid friend
Away from home are they and I
Had this one day not been
"Morning" means "milking" to the farmer
To be forgot by thee
Title divine is mine!
So proud she was to die
All I may if small
The trees like tassels hit and swung
How many flowers fail in wood
We knew not that we were to live
I cross till I am weary
As imperceptibly as grief
Take your heaven further on
Before you thought of spring
Soft as the massacre of suns
The way I read a letter's this
Finite to fail but infinite to venture
Always mine!
A full fed rose on meals of tint
Image of light, adieu
Soul, take thy risk
"They have not chosen me" - he said
Those dying then
Flowers - Well - if anybody
You love the Lord you cannot see
The Himmaleh was known to stoop
An altered look about the hills
The things that never can come back are several
Morns like these we parted
Sweet - you forgot - but I remembered
The missing all prevented me
She slept beneath a tree
Me prove it now - Whoever doubt
"Go traveling with us"!
This is a blossom of the brain
The robin is the one
Not what we did shall be the test
Here where the daisies fit my head
To offer brave assistance
Nobody knows this little rose
I think I was enchanted
Let down the bars, oh death
Good night! Which put the candle out?
Unto the whole how add?
As we pass houses musing slow
Guest am I to have
The last of summer is a time
I can wade grief
I stole them from a bee
He was weak, and I was strong then
Did we disobey him?
There comes an hour when begging stops
The immortality she gave
We like a hairbreadth 'scape
"Faithful to the end" amended
The long sigh of the frog
Some one prepared this mighty show
He was my host - he was my guest
The luxury to apprehend
'Tis so appalling it exhilirates
Risk is the hair that holds the tun
I watched her face to see which way
A sparrow took a slice of twig
He put the belt around my life
Between my country and the others
A sparrow took a slice of twig
The sun retired to a cloud
The admirations and contempts of time
The only ghost I ever saw
How noteless men and Pleiads stand
The luxury to apprehend
Let my first knowing be of thee
Their dappled importunity
The butterfly's Numidian gown
Had I known that the first was the last
The words the happy say
"Faithful to the end" amended
The sun and fog contested
Why should we hurry - why indeed
It's such a little thing to weep
The doomed regard the sunrise
I know some lonely houses off the road
I stole them from a bee
How news must feel when travelling
Rather arid delight
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple
The event was directly behind him
The rat is the concisest tenant
'Tis customary as we part
I had a guinea golden
When I hoped, I recollect
Where I am not afraid to go
Reportless subjects, to the quick
All circumstances are the frame
Death is a dialogue between
The robin is the one
To lose one's faith surpass
The feet of people walking home
I heard as if I had no ear
There comes a warning like a spy
No autumn's interceptive chill
It struck me every day
Morns like these we parted
"Why do I love" you, sir?
Soul, wilt thou toss again?
Flowers - Well - if anybody
I was the slightest in the house
Within thy grave!
For every bird a nest
None who saw it ever told it
Lives he in any other world
I cannot buy it - 'tis not sold
The murmuring of bees has ceased
The bird did prance - the bee did play
Just as he spoke it from his hands
The child's faith is new
A tongue to tell him I am true!
Before you thought of spring
A little snow was here and there
As imperceptibly as grief
Answer July
How many flowers fail in the wood
I tie my hat - I crease my shawl
The things we thought that we should do
Victory comes late
I never saw a moor
Away from home are some and I
Forever cherished be the tree
'Tis anguish grander than delight
Could hope inspect her basis
How slow the wind - how slow the sea
Silence is all we dread
To the bright east she flies
Wait till the majesty of death
It will be summer eventually
Like flowers that heard the news of dews
I cant tell you, but you feel it
Trusty as the stars
They leave us with the infinite
How well I knew her not
The inundation of the spring
Some rainbow coming from the fair!
As far from pity as complaint
Within my garden rides a bird
At last to be identified!
Of Paradise' existence
A bird came down the walk
Given in marriage unto thee
These held their wick above the west
The most triumphant bird
Is it true, dear Sue?
Partake as doth the bee
Nature and God I neither knew
To see her is a picture
Jesus! thy crucifix
"Was not" was all the statement
To be forgot by thee
The face we choose to miss
Where roses would not dare to go
I pay in satin cash
He gave away his life
Twice had summer her fair verdure
These are the nights that beetles love
We do not know the time we lose
'Twas a long parting - but the time
Dying! To be afraid of thee
I fear a man of frugal speech
Oh, honey of an hour
Belshazzar had a letter
Funny to be a century
How the waters closed above him
My garden like the beach
"Good night," because we must!
"They have not chosen me" - he said
A long - long sleep
If I should see a single bird
New feet within my garden go
After the sun comes out
Meeting by accident
Not "Revelation" 'tis that waits
Besides this May
To love thee year by year
One day is there of the series
Gratitude is not the mention
If I can stop one heart from breaking
The day undressed herself
If those I loved were lost
Bind me I still can sing
I gained it so
Not seeing, still we know
The bird her punctual music brings
As if I asked a common alms
The battle fought between the soul
My eye is fuller than my vase
A solemn thing it was I said
It's like the light
You love me - you are sure
A dew sufficed itself
The hills erect their purple heads
How the old mountains drip with sunset
In snow thou comest
Delight's despair at setting
If my bark sink
Peril as a possession
Wert thou but ill that I might show thee
Tie the strings to my life, my Lord
Of all the sounds despatched abroad
Denial is the only fact
The lilac is an ancient shrub
The gleam of an heroic act
To his simplicity
The mob within the heart
Is immortality a bane
To disappear enhances
Love's stricken "why"
Is it too late to touch you, dear?
Love can do all but raise the dead
Of God we ask one favor
I sued the news yet feared the news
To disappear enhances
To his simplicity
Beauty crowds me till I die
The most important population
"Unto me"? I do not know you
Of all the sounds despatched abroad
Is heaven a physician?
Glory is that bright tragic thing
Had I not seen the sun
Of nearness to her sundered things
The only news I know
Of tribulation these are they
Which is the best - the moon or the crescent?
With sweetness unabated
Sometimes with the heart
A dew sufficed itself
Alone I cannot be
My river runs to thee
Musicians wrestling everywhere!
I breathed enough to take the trick
How fleet - how indiscreet an one
'Tis customary as we part
There is a morn by men unseen
The future never spoke
There is no silence in the earth so silent
If those I loved were lost
How much of source escapes with thee
Gratitude is not the mention
The day undressed herself
Only a shrine but mine
To love thee year by year
And this of all my hopes
Best gains must have the losses' test
The sun went down - no man looked on
The Bible is an untold volume
Distance is not the realm of fox
I hide myself within my flower
Elysium is as far as to
Heart not so heavy as mine
Without this there is nought
That first day, when you praised me, Sweet
"Good night," because we must!
Belshazzar had a letter
So set it's sun in thee
You know that portrait in the moon
I had no cause to be awake
Oh, honey of an hour
There is another loneliness
Dying! To be afraid of thee
Forever is composed of nows
Before he comes we weigh the time
After a hundred years
We learned the whole of love
One anguish in a crowd
By homely gifts and hindered words
In this short life that only lasts an hour
Her losses make our gains ashamed
Nature and God I neither knew
"Was not" was all the statement
Jesus! thy crucifix
The clock strikes one
Could I - then - shut the door
The most triumphant bird
These strangers in a foreign world
Given in marriage unto thee
"Tomorrow" whose location
March is the month of expectation
The soul has bandaged moments
Is bliss then such abyss
Except to heaven she is nought
Some rainbow coming from the fair!
I know that he exists
At last to be identified!
How know it from a summer's day?
This world is not conclusion
I tend my flowers for thee
The daisy follows soft the sun
The sun kept stooping - stooping - low!
These held their wick above the west
How much the present moment means
Teach him when he makes the names
So pleased she was to die
As sleigh bells seem in summer
Ample make this bed
The most triumphant bird
No rose, yet felt myself a'bloom
The lassitudes of contemplation
The definition of beauty is
Her losses make our gains ashamed
A dying tiger moaned for drink
My period had come for prayer
Not what we did shall be the test
This is my letter to the world
Dying! To be afraid of thee
Too cold is this
Behold this little bane
The bird did prance - the bee did play
Unable are the loved to die
Not probable - the barest chance
Those not live yet
The duties of the wind are few
Your thoughts dont have words every day
Rehearsal to ourselves
Of being is a bird
Heart not so heavy as mine
South winds jostle them
That I did always love
Whole gulfs of red and fleets of red
The world feels dusty
My wars are laid away in books
Cosmopolites without a plea
Bee! I'm expecting you!
The beggar lad dies early
Pain has but one acquaintance
Come show thy Durham breast
My cocoon tightens - Colors teaze
Not "Revelation" 'tis that waits
I cannot be ashamed
As if I asked a common alms
The soul's superior instants
The life that tied too tight escapes
At half past three a single bird
The dandelion's pallid tube
The gentian weaves her fringes
Death sets a thing significant
The bumble of a bee
The nearest dream recedes unrealized
"Heaven" is what I cannot reach!
"Faithful to the end" amended
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
He went by sleep that drowsy route
Winter is good - his hoar delights
The show is not the show
A dew sufficed itself
I taste a liquor never brewed
If I could tell how glad I was
Until the desert knows
Doubt me! My dim companion!
The first day that I was a life
Consulting summer's clock
The luxury to apprehend
Before I got my eye put out
Look back on time with kindly eyes
Those cattle smaller than a bee
A chastened grace is twice a grace
If all the griefs I am to have
Who giants know, with lesser men
The joy that has no stem nor core
To tell the beauty would decrease
The treason of an accent
That it will never come again
By my window have I for scenery
The treason of an accent
Endanger it, and the demand
Of God we ask one favor
The long sigh of the frog
Her face was in a bed of hair
Before I got my eye put out
The only news I know
It is the meek that valor wear
Tell all the truth but tell it slant
By a departing light
A nearness to tremendousness
Many a phrase has the English language
The right to perish might be thought
I taste a liquor never brewed
Nature assigns the sun
The show is not the show
The spider as an artist
Witchcraft has not a pedigree
Kill your balm and it's odors bless you
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
That sacred closet when you sweep
The murmur of a bee
The maddest dream recedes unrealized
The things that never can come back are several
What I can do I will
A brief but patient illness
The soul's superior instants
As if I asked a common alms
The last night that she lived
On that specific pillow
The bustle in a house
He lived the life of ambush
Faith is the pierless bridge
The robin is the one
The beggar lad dies early
Satisfaction is the agent
Gratitude is not the mention
He ate and drank the precious words
Rests at night
The pattern of the sun
South winds jostle them
A solemn thing within the soul
Smiling back from coronation
We cover thee - sweet face
Heart not so heavy as mine
Whoever disenchants
The duties of the wind are few
The martyr poets did not tell
When night is almost done
Spurn the temerity
Tell as a marksman were forgotten
Unable are the loved to die
I made slow riches but my gain
My maker - let me be
There is another loneliness
When I was small, a woman died
Peace is a fiction of our faith
It feels a shame to be alive
A dying tiger moaned for drink
His losses made our gains ashamed
Witchcraft was hung in history
The veins of other flowers
Ample make this bed
"Morning" means "milking" to the farmer
The most triumphant bird
So fain she was to die
Tho' I get home how late - how late
The spry arms of the wind
A field of stubble lying sere
These held their wick above the west
A wounded deer leaps highest
He strained my faith
To hang our head ostensibly
Summer laid her simple hat
A fuzzy fellow without feet
After great pain a formal feeling comes
The sun is one - and on the tare
Pictures are to daily faces
Summer laid her simple hat
The robin for the crumb
A bird came down the walk
I met a king this afternoon!
To learn the transport by the pain
A field of stubble lying sere
I dreaded that first robin so
This consciousness that is aware
A sloop of amber slips away
To see her is a picture
Ample make this bed
Bloom opon the mountain stated
Yesterday is history
Not one by heaven defrauded stay
The wind begun to knead the grass
'Tis not that dying hurts us so
There is a pain so utter
Absent place an April day
Fame is the tint that scholars leave
They have a little odor that to me
'Tis my first night beneath the sun
The healed heart shows it's shallow scar
A tooth opon our peace
To know just how he suffered would be dear
Brother of Ophir
Exhiliration is the breeze
Of tolling bell I ask the cause?
Impossibility like wine
When Etna basks and purrs
One of the ones that Midas touched
I've seen a dying eye
Beauty be not caused - It is
I dwell in possibility
As by the dead we love to sit
The frost of death was on the pane
He fumbles at your soul
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
His bill is locked, his eye estranged
We should not mind so small a flower
How happy is the little stone
If any sink, assure that this now standing
When roses cease to bloom, sir
The wind tapped like a tired man
Obtaining but our own extent
The sky is low - the clouds are mean
Echo has no magistrate
If nature smiles - the mother must
Aurora is the effort
To undertake is to achieve
The leaves like women interchange
The mind lives on the heart
For this - accepted breath
The last of summer is a time
She sweeps with many-colored brooms
To do a magnanimous thing
A dew sufficed itself
What we see we know somewhat
I'll tell you how the sun rose
A feather from the whippowil
A word left careless on a page
The lonesome for they know not what
Midsummer was it when they died
They talk as slow as legends grow
Lightly stepped a yellow star
I know of people in the grave
Those final creatures - who they are
Of all the sounds despatched abroad
A drop fell on the apple tree
The stars are old that stood for me
To make routine a stimulus
Pain expands the time
Proud of my broken heart, since thou did'st break it
To disappear enhances
One crown that no one seeks
Fitter to see him I may be
A drop fell on the apple tree
The stars are old that stood for me
The wind drew off
Her smile was shaped like other smiles
Unto a broken heart
The look of thee what is it like
Midsummer was it when they died
The ones that disappeared are back
A word dropped careless on a page
A feather from the whippowil
There came a day at summer's full
She sweeps with many-colored brooms
I'll tell you how the sun rose
So I pull my stockings off
A dew sufficed itself
His mind of man a secret makes
The last of summer is a time
Musicians wrestle everywhere
The mind lives on the heart
To undertake is to achieve
The leaves like women interchange
Dew is the freshet in the grass
Sweet pirate of the heart
Dying at my music!
To interrupt his yellow plan
Oh if remembering were forgetting
I cannot meet the spring unmoved
Come show thy Durham breast
How happy is the little stone
The night was wide and furnished scant
He told a homely tale
She bore it till the simple veins
His bill is clasped - his eye forsook
The frost of death was on the pane
As by the dead we love to sit
He fumbles at your soul
The name of it is "autumn"
No crowd that has occurred
To fill a gap
So set it's sun in thee
Belshazzar had a letter
A mine there is no man would own
Best witchcraft is geometry
Of tolling bell I ask the cause?
It was too late for man
Sister of Ophir - Ah Peru
How ruthless are the gentle
The wind took up the northern things
I know where wells grow - droughtless wells
The birds begun at four o'clock
Two travellers perishing in snow
When the astronomer stops seeking
Three times we parted - breath and I
It is not dying hurts us so
Not one by heaven defrauded stay
The wind begun to knead the grass
Bloom opon the mountain stated
The beggar at the door for fame
To see her is a picture
Ample make this bed
The clock strikes one
A wild blue sky abreast of winds
To learn the transport thro' the pain
This consciousness that is aware
He showed me hights I never saw
A bird came down the walk
The robin for the crumb
The sun kept stooping - stooping - low!
Summer laid her simple hat
Except to heaven she is nought
Gathered into the earth
Summer laid her simple hat
The worthlessness of earthly things
I envy seas whereon he rides
Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
I could not drink it, Sue
If the foolish call them "flowers"
If it had no pencil
Sweet to have had them lost
I felt my life with both my hands
With thee in the desert
No brigadier throughout the year
The clock strikes one
There is no frigate like a book
The definition of beauty is
Blossoms will run away
I think that the root of the wind is water
Left in immortal youth
All but death can be adjusted
Escaping backward to perceive
They have a little odor that to me
It troubled me as once I was
Apology for her
My maker - let me be
I asked no other thing
Before he comes we weigh the time
Like eyes that looked on wastes
These fevered days to take them to the forest
A spider sewed at night
Dont put up my thread  needle
Those who have been in the grave the longest
Our little kinsmen after rain
The work of her that went
He parts himself like leaves
No rack can torture me
South winds jostle them
Paradise is of the option
I hide myself within my flower
You constituted time
Just once! Oh least request!
The rainbow never tells me
I fit for them - I seek the dark
Pompless no life can pass away
Obtaining but his own extent
I lived on dread
Summer for thee, grant I may be
Much madness is divinest sense
Love is anterior to life
God is a distant - stately lover
He lived the life of ambush
At half past three a single bird
To undertake is to achieve
The stimulus beyond the grave
Frequently the woods are pink
A secret told
Perception of an object costs
What if I say I shall not wait!
The last of summer is a time
The mind lives on the heart
There came a day at summer's full
I lost a world the other day!
I thought that nature was enough
The past is such a curious creature
Come slowly - Eden!
If I'm lost now
That love is all there is
Through what transports of patience
The butterfly obtains
I see thee clearer for the grave
Of yellow was the outer sky
Color - caste - denomination
Oh shadow on the grass!
Like brooms of steel
Take all away
The blunder is in estimate
Her final summer was it
Volcanoes be in Sicily
I suppose the time will come
So much of heaven has gone from earth
A drop fell on the apple tree
He who in himself believes
Oh shadow on the grass!
There is a solitude of space
Eden is that old fashioned house
As subtle as tomorrow
Fame is a fickle food
Like time's insidious wrinkle
Least rivers docile to some sea
Now I knew I lost her
Delight is as the flight
There came a day at summer's full
The show is not the show
If I should'nt be alive
The mind lives on the heart
A shady friend for torrid days
The heart is the capital of the mind
There is a flower that bees prefer
In the name of the bee
Lest this be heaven indeed
Dew is the freshet in the grass
At half past three a single bird
His bill an augur is
'Twas warm at first like us
His feet are shod with gauze
Who abdicated ambush
The moon upon her fluent route
Did you ever stand in a cavern's mouth
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
One and one are one
Just once! Oh least request!
Pompless no life can pass away
The frost of death was on the pane
One dignity delays for all
I hide myself within my flower
Paradise is of the option
My faith is larger than the hills
Death is potential to that man
South winds jostle them
I started early - took my dog
An everywhere of silver
Best witchcraft is geometry
A spider sewed at night
Not all die early dying young
Triumph may be of several kinds
Only God detect the sorrow
To mend each tattered faith
My maker - let me be
Spring is the period
It makes no difference abroad
The heart has narrow banks
A still volcano life
Light is sufficient to itself
The mountain sat opon the plain
Elijah's wagon knew no thill
Publication is the auction
The wind begun to knead the grass
A deed knocks first at thought
It would not know if it were spurned
There is no frigate like a book
The clock strikes one
To see her is a picture
The rose did caper on her cheek
A wife at daybreak I shall be
Perhaps I asked too large
Good to have had them lost
I could not drink it, Sweet
I showed her hights she never saw
In ebon box when years have flown
The worthlessness of earthly things
Those fair - fictitious people
Summer laid her simple hat
As if some little Arctic flower
He touched me, so I live to know
Soto! Explore thyself!
There is a June when corn is cut
If anybody's friend be dead
Through the straight pass of suffering
The flake the wind exasperate
'Twas the old road through pain
In many and reportless places
A single clover plank
The wind begun to knead the grass
So the eyes accost and sunder
There is no frigate like a book
Lad of Athens, faithful be
Who were "the Father and the Son"
We shun it ere it comes
A sloop of amber slips away
Speech is a prank of parliament
A death blow is a life blow to some
A pit but heaven over it
The spider holds a silver ball
Banish air from air
As imperceptibly as grief
Were it to be the last
The snow that never drifts
One crucifixion is recorded only
Of tolling bell I ask the cause?
So well that I can live without
Brother of ingots - Ah Peru
How good his lava bed
The tint I cannot take is best
Her grace is all she has
The whole of it came not at once
"Go tell it" - what a message
Between the form of life and life
This heart that broke so long
Angels in the early morning
Some wretched creature, savior take
Fame of myself to justify
The province of the saved
Have you got a brook in your little heart
'Tis one by one the Father counts
The feet of people walking home
Three weeks passed since I had seen her
Sweet - you forgot - but I remembered
A narrow fellow in the grass
The crickets sang
I heard as if I had no ear
If recollecting were forgetting
Said death to passion
Prayer is the little implement
No matter where the saints abide
How happy is the little stone
We'll pass without the parting
From cocoon forth a butterfly
Poor little heart!
Our own possessions - though our own
Read - Sweet - how others strove
There's a certain slant of light
The sea said "Come" to the brook
The thought beneath so slight a film
After all birds have been investigated
To die takes just a little while
The mind lives on the heart
Extol thee could I - then I will
Remembrance has a rear and front
Of his peculiar light
Unfulfilled to observation
We can but follow to the sun
Shall I take thee, the poet said
Today or this noon
To their apartment deep
Not any sunny tone
Summer begins to have the look
A clover's simple fame
When we have ceased to care
The clover's simple fame
Of this is day composed
These are the days that reindeer love
On my volcano grows the grass
A drop fell on the apple tree
Fly - fly - but as you fly
How firm eternity must look
Because my brook is fluent
"Red Sea" indeed! Talk not to me
Love is that later thing than death
"Hope" is the thing with feathers
After all birds have been investigated
Not any more to be lacked
Of bronze and blaze
Faith is a fine invention
The sea said "Come" to the brook
Our own possessions - though our own
The skies cant keep their secret!
Good night! Which put the candle out?
How happy is the little stone
Her sweet weight on my heart a night
The birds begun at four o'clock
What care the dead for Chanticleer
Air has no residence, no neighbor
Garlands for queens may be
Now I lay thee down to sleep
The crickets sang
Not so the infinite relations - below
Sweet - you forgot - but I remembered
A sickness of this world it most occasions
It's all I have to bring today
Ashes denote that fire was
Exhiliration is within
'Tis true - They shut me in the cold
Water is taught by thirst
A diamond on the hand
Went up a year this evening!
He fought like those who've nought to lose
From blank to blank
We should not mind so small a flower
I cannot meet the spring unmoved
I groped for him before I knew
His mind like fabrics of the east
Her grace is all she has
Why make it doubt - it hurts it so
At leisure is the soul
Not that he goes we love him more
That odd old man is dead a year
These tested our horizon
The sweetest heresy received
As willing lid o'er weary eye
Great streets of silence led away
A light exists in spring
Unto my books so good to turn
A pit but heaven over it
A death blow is a life blow to some
Title divine is mine!
A sloop of amber slips away
Pompless no life can pass away
Who were "the Father and the Son"
My soul accused me and I quailed
Lad of Athens, faithful be
There is no frigate like a book
Longing is like the seed
The wind begun to rock the grass
Touch lightly nature's sweet guitar
Death warrants are supposed to be
'Twas the old road through pain
I'm ceded - I've stopped being their's
There is a June when corn is cut
The juggler's hat her country is
If I could bribe them by a rose
Soto! Explore thyself!
I would not paint a picture
A wife at daybreak I shall be
Hope is a strange invention
Love reckons by itself alone
It was not death, for I stood up
I had the glory - that will do
To this world she returned
Portraits are to daily faces
Dust is the only secret
Dreams are the subtle dower
A saucer holds a cup
Elijah's wagon had no thill
My worthiness is all my doubt
Truth is as old as God
Longing is like the seed
Forever cherished be the tree
The lovely flowers embarrass me
No brigadier throughout the year
Of Brussels it was not
When one has given up one's life
How far is it to heaven?
Light is sufficient to itself
It might be lonelier
As imperceptibly as grief
We knew not that we were to live
I noticed people disappeared
The day grew small, surrounded tight
Not all die early dying young
The power to be true to you
A chilly peace infests the grass
Opon what brittle piers
The smouldering embers blush
Glee - The great storm is over
Just once! Oh least request!
My nosegays are for captives
There is a strength in proving that it can be borne
Count not that far that can be had
On such a night, or such a night
Wolfe demanded during dying
For death - or rather
Myself was formed a carpenter
Endow the living with the tears
Spring comes on the world
The crickets sang
A narrow fellow in the grass
His oriental heresies
The missing all prevented me
The day that I was crowned
A shade opon the mind there passes
Echo has no magistrate
The moon upon her fluent route
Nobody knows this little rose
Undue significance a starving man attaches
Now I knew I lost her
Faith is a fine invention
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple
Put up my lute!
The last of summer is result
I've heard an organ talk sometimes
He preached about breadth till we knew he  was narrow
Winter under cultivation
After all birds have been investigated
The heart is the capital of the mind
Dying! Dying in the night!
The clouds their backs together laid
This docile one inter
This merit hath the worst
Robbed by death but that was easy
A little dog that wags his tail
Summer begins to have a look
'Twas just this time last year I died
A cap of lead across the sky
A lane of yellow led the eye
'Tis sunrise - little maid - Hast thou
Judgment is justest
Till death is narrow loving
In winter in my room
I did not reach thee
Speech is one symptom of affection
Advance is life's condition
When we stand on the tops of things
I make his crescent fill or lack
A little dog that wags his tail
Like rain it sounded till it curved
It bloomed and dropt a single noon
Through those old grounds of memory
Morning is the place for dew
The heart is the capital of the mind
After all birds have been investigated
There came a day at summer's full
'Tis easier to pity those when dead
He preached opon "breadth" till it argued  him narrow
A transport one cannot contain
The last of summer is delight
Faith is a fine invention
The sea said "Come" to the brook
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple
The moon upon her fluent route
Forget! The lady with the amulet
Nobody knows this little rose
'Tis opposites entice
How happy is the little stone
All circumstances are the frame
His oriental heresies
A narrow fellow in the grass
He scanned it - staggered
Somewhat to hope for
Perception of an object costs
Endow the living with the tears
We pray to heaven
For death - or rather
Whose are the little beds - I asked
Count not that far that can be had
Most she touched me by her muteness
Because I could not stop for death
The merchant of the picturesque
Sexton! My master's sleeping here
The murmuring of bees has ceased
Than heaven more remote
Sweet - safe - houses
I live with him - I see his face
Death is the supple suitor
The day grew small, surrounded tight
Not all die early dying young
As imperceptibly as grief
The longest day that God appoints
Forbidden fruit a flavor has
Some work for immortality
Like mighty foot lights burned the red
A death blow is a life blow to some
A light exists in spring
He found my being - set it up
No brigadier throughout the year
Forever honored be the tree
Away from home are they and I
Truth is as old as God
Longing is like the seed
Power is a familiar growth
Growth of man like growth of nature
The bat is dun with wrinkled wings
His heart was darker than the starless night
Dust is the only secret
To this world she returned
She sights a bird - she chuckles
I cautious scanned my little life
Hope is a strange invention
A wife at daybreak I shall be
If you were coming in the fall
How well I knew her not
The fact that earth is heaven
Good morning - midnight
With pinions of disdain
The pile of years is not so high
Bring me the sunset in a cup
Although I put away his life
Empty my heart of thee
Who never lost are unprepared
As summer into autumn slips
When a lover is a beggar
Circumference thou bride of awe
A drunkard cannot meet a cork
I saw that the flake was on it
Essential oils are wrung
It dropped so low in my regard
It sounded as if the air were running
Lain in nature so suffice us
The spirit lasts but in what mode
Sweet mountains - ye tell me no lie
No prisoner be
But little carmine hath her face
Safe despair it is that raves
Too few the mornings be
Love is done when love's begun
It's coming - the postponeless creature
You left me - sire - two legacies
It was a quiet way
His voice decrepit was with joy
Their barricade against the sky
Size circumscribes - it has no room
Too little way the house must lie
A door just opened on a street
The incidents of love
Contained in this short life
I many times thought peace had come
I stepped from plank to plank
Success is counted sweetest
'Twas like a maelstrom with a notch
Embarrassment of one another
Ambition cannot find him
If this is "fading"
Superiority to fate
I never felt at home below
Trudging to Eden looking backward
The guest is gold and crimson
Her "last Poems"
More than the grave is closed to me
"And with what body do they come"?
When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany  her side
You'll know her by her foot
She rose as high as his occasion
I hav'nt told my garden yet
When I hoped I feared
This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies
Who is the east?
Falsehood of thee could I suppose
Two lengths has every day
It sifts from leaden sieves
Not with a club the heart is broken
You're right - "the way is narrow"
The overtakelessness of those
Civilization spurns the leopard!
The zeros taught us phosphorus
The truth is stirless
A mien to move a queen
Should you but fail at sea
As from the earth the light balloon
Betrothed to righteousness might be
The pungent atom in the air
Go thy great way!
The days that we can spare
On the bleakness of my lot
It was a grave yet bore no stone
Step lightly on this narrow spot
It was a grave yet bore no stone
Somewhere opon the general earth
The days that we can spare
Go thy great way!
On the bleakness of my lot
It came at last but prompter death
Show me eternity, and I will show you memory
Oh future! thou secreted peace
Again his voice is at the door
A south wind has a pathos
The zeros taught us phosphorus
The drop that wrestles in the sea
The court is far away
Going to them, happy letter!
Further in summer than the birds
It sifts from leaden sieves
The mushroom is the elf of plants
His mansion in the pool
Fate slew him but he did not drop
The first we knew of him was death
When I hoped I feared
I never lost as much but twice
Up life's hill with my little bundle
The opening and the close
The savior must have been
The red blaze is the morning
Whose cheek is this?
We do not play on graves
Through lane it lay - thro' bramble
My season's furthest flower
Of whom so dear
As watchers hang opon the east
The body grows without
Revolution is the pod
To one denied to drink
I gave myself to him
Ambition cannot find him
Success is counted sweetest
Contained in this short life
The lady feeds her little bird
You said that I "was great" one day
A man may make a remark
The suburbs of a secret
Their barricade against the sky
The soul's distinct connection
I cannot live with you
It was a quiet way
I could suffice for him I knew
How destitute is he
The road to Paradise is plain
Of so divine a loss
I send two sunsets
It knew no medicine
Safe despair it is that raves
Behind me dips eternity
It tossed and tossed
I sometimes drop it for a quick
Immured in heaven!
To break so vast a heart
It sounded as if the streets were running
I saw that the flake was on it
Essential oils are wrung
'Tis not the swaying frame we miss
Circumference thou bride of awe
The butterfly's assumption gown
I cried at pity - not at pain
No man saw awe, nor to his house
A lady red amid the hill
She died at play
Time does go on
Over and over like a tune
Ourselves we do inter with sweet derision
To own a Susan of my own
I like to see it lap the miles
She went as quiet as the dew
Who never wanted - maddest joy
To the unwilling dust
Not knowing when the dawn will come
Who never lost is unprepared
As summer into autumn slips
I shall not murmur if at last
I took one draught of life
One need not be a chamber to be haunted
Elisabeth told Essex
Bring me the sunset in a cup
Within that little hive
Her sweet turn to leave the homestead
The months have ends - the years a knot
There are two Mays
Had we our senses
Renunciation is a piercing virtue
We miss her not because we see
The butterfly in honored dust
Nature the gentlest mother is
"Heaven" has different signs to me
She dwelleth in the ground
A house opon the hight
Lest they should come is all my fear
This slow day moved along
But little carmine hath her face
They put us far apart
The sweets of pillage can be known
Fame is the one that does not stay
We like March - his shoes are purple
No man can compass a despair
Each second is the last
"Heavenly Father" - take to thee
Alone and in a circumstance
Of nature I shall have enough
What shall I do when the summer troubles
In falling timbers buried
When they come back - if blossoms do
I never felt at home below
Her breast is fit for pearls
"Arcturus" is his other name
The color of the grave is green
Could I but ride indefinite
My friend must be a bird
It did not surprise me
I am alive - I guess
Of silken speech and specious shoe
"And with what body do they come"?
I saw the wind within her
Tho' my destiny be fustian
The guest is gold and crimson
Her "last Poems"
How still the bells in steeples stand
That such have died enable us
To help our bleaker parts
From all the jails the boys and girls
One sister have I in our house
There is a zone whose even years
Not with a club the heart is broken
Two lengths has every day
That after horror - that 'twas us
I've nothing else to bring, you know
The love a life can show below
There is an arid pleasure
Further in summer than the birds
Going to him! Happy letter!
Let me not mar that perfect dream
One life of so much consequence!
But that defeated accent
Deprived of other banquet
Still own thee - still thou art
Step lightly on this narrow spot
Sweet is the swamp with it's secrets
Defrauded I a butterfly
They say that "Time assuages"
The days that we can spare
They say that "Time assuages"
'Twas fighting for his life he was
Step lightly on this narrow spot
"I want" it pleaded all it's life
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee
It is a lonesome glee
So give me back to death
I held it so tight that I lost it
Going to her!
Further in summer than the birds
The lamp burns sure within
Luck is not chance
I've nothing else to bring, you know
To wait an hour is long
The love a child can show below
That after horror - that 'twas us
To pile like thunder to it's close
The way to know the bobolink
One sister have I in the house
Above oblivion's tide there is a pier
I've dropped my brain - My soul is numb
Which is best? Heaven
I was a phebe - nothing more
Sang from the heart, sire
Just lost, when I was saved!
Facts by our side are never sudden
Her "last Poems"
I counted till they danced so
Except the smaller size
When I count the seeds
You cannot make remembrance grow
How fortunate the grave
Our share of night to bear
So bashful when I spied her!
To whom the mornings stand for nights
The first day's night had come
I found the words to every thought
Nor mountain hinder me
As watchers hang opon the east
This was a poet
The suburbs of a secret
Drab habitation of whom?
The bird must sing to earn the crumb
Contained in this short life
His cheek is his biographer
We like March - his shoes are purple
We talked with each other about each other
The sun kept setting - setting - still
Me from myself to banish
The sweets of pillage can be known
We never know how high we are
Reverse cannot befall
I had not minded walls
On the world you colored
She dwelleth in the ground
Unit, like death, for whom?
On a columnar self
We miss her not because we see
The butterfly in honored dust
Art thou the thing I wanted?
Never for society
Removed from accident of loss
There are two Mays
Quite empty, quite at rest
Pain has an element of blank
One need not be a chamber to be haunted
'Houses' - so the wise men tell me
Floss wont save you from an abyss
Lay this laurel on the one
As summer into autumn slips
A little bread - a crust - a crumb
A flower will not trouble her
The face I carry with me last
To the unwilling dust
Water makes many beds
Where I have lost I softer tread
Departed to the Judgment
Just lost, when I was saved!
No man saw awe, nor to his house
My heart ran so to thee
She died at play
To the unwilling dust
A world made penniless by that departure
I reason, earth is short
It was a quiet seeming day
Papa above!
Shame is the shawl of pink
The grace myself might not obtain
Because that you are going
Confirming all who analyze
Conscious am I in my chamber
Give little anguish
To try to speak and miss the way
Declaiming waters none may dread
Strong draughts of their refreshing minds
The voice that stands for floods to me
I send two sunsets
'Twas love not me
We like March - his shoes are purple
There is a languor of the life
No other can reduce
It's easy to invent a life
Trust adjusts her "peradventure"
On that dear frame the years had worn
Be mine the doom
My God he sees thee
A route of evanescence
Oh sumptuous moment
A little overflowing word
I am ashamed - I hide
If he were living - dare I ask
How destitute is he
These are the days when birds come back
There's something quieter than sleep
We learn in the retreating
I read my sentence steadily
Sunset at night is natural
The well opon the brook
The bee is not afraid of me
A prison gets to be a friend
A pang is more conspicuous in spring
Experiment to me
Superfluous were the sun
The soul should always stand ajar
To own the art within the soul
A poor - torn heart - a tattered heart
The savior must have been
"Lethe" in my flower
So glad we are a stranger'd deem
Through lane it lay - thro' bramble
The brain is wider than the sky
Her spirit rose to such a hight
The chemical conviction
I should have been too glad, I see
'Twould ease a butterfly
Opon a lilac sea
The drop that wrestles in the sea
We - bee and I - live by the quaffing
Her sovreign people
Of all the souls that stand create
The mushroom is the elf of plants
Some keep the Sabbath going to church
A bee his burnished carriage
She staked her feathers - gained an arc
The mountains stood in haze
Remembrance has a rear and front
Time feels so vast that were it not
Fame is a bee
I meant to find her when I came
Upon his saddle sprung a bird
The pedigree of honey
The pedigree of honey
The service without hope
Upon his saddle sprung a bird
I should not dare to be so sad
The saddest noise, the sweetest noise
She rose to his requirement - dropt
It was a grave yet bore no stone
Are friends delight or pain?
How soft this prison is
Some keep the Sabbath going to church
The mushroom is the elf of plants
We - bee and I - live by the quaffing
The world stands solemner to me
The overtakelessness of those
'Twould ease a butterfly
I should have been too glad, I see
The robin's my criterion for tune
Opon a lilac sea
'Tis little I could care for pearls
There is a word
Who occupies this house?
Her spirit rose to such a hight
The savior must have been
A poor - torn heart - a tattered heart
I think the longest hour of all
"Lethe" in my flower
Ideals are the fairy oil
This quiet dust was gentlemen and ladies
How happy I was if I could forget
A pang is more conspicuous in spring
Best things dwell out of sight
Nature sometimes sears a sapling
It was not saint - it was too large
We grow accustomed to the dark
Where bells no more affright the morn
These are the days when birds come back
A murmur in the trees to note
What twigs we held by
I keep my pledge
The spirit is the conscious ear
The devil had he fidelity
A winged spark doth soar about
Had we known the ton she bore
My portion is defeat today
Be mine the doom
It's little ether hood
I bet with every wind that blew
Nature affects to be sedate
They wont frown always - some sweet day
God gave a loaf to every bird
No other can reduce
When diamonds are a legend
The brain within it's groove
Society for me my misery
"Remember me" implored the thief!
A visitor in marl
Declaiming waters none may dread
These saw visions
Give little anguish
A drunkard cannot meet a cork
The day she goes
Conscious am I in my chamber
Four trees opon a solitary acre
September's baccalaureate
Sweet skepticism of the heart
Papa above!
The fairest home I ever knew
A world made penniless by his departure
To the stanch dust
Cocoon above! Cocoon below!
Abraham to kill him
To put this world down like a bundle
I think the hemlock likes to stand
To flee from memory
Mute thy coronation
I reason, earth is short
Whether they have forgotten
Exultation is the going
A little bread - a crust - a crumb
The most pathetic thing I do
The morning after wo
How human nature dotes
To earn it by disdaining it
We talked as girls do
You taught me waiting with myself
Morning is due to all
Opon what brittle piers
Silence is all we dread
Art thou the thing I wanted?
The birds reported from the south
There are two Mays
To try to speak and miss the way
When continents expire
The robin is a troubadour
We like March - his shoes are purple
Reverse cannot befall
Through the dark sod as education
Of Paul and Silas it is said
Where thou art that is home
Joy to have merited the pain
Some days retired from the rest
The judge is like the owl
As one does sickness over
The sun is gay or stark
The life we have is very great
The way hope builds his house
Shells from the coast mistaking
As frost is best conceived
Except the heaven had come so near
The soul unto itself
If wrecked opon the bay of thought
Success is counted sweetest
A charm invests a face
Themself are all I have
Ended ere it begun
Not in this world to see his face
These are the days when birds come back
A throe opon the features
There is a finished feeling
The fingers of the light
The morns are meeker than they were
Crumbling is not an instant's act
The heart asks pleasure first
Experiment to me
All that I do
I often passed the village
The lightning playeth all the while
Bless God, he went as soldiers
My heart opon a little plate
Except the smaller size
Mine enemy is growing old
Fame's boys and girls, who never die
A word is dead when it is said
The sun just touched the morning
I came to buy a smile today
I should have been too glad, I see
Severer service of myself
This is the land the sunset washes
To pile like thunder to it's close
The mushroom is the elf of plants
Who court obtain within himself
Frigid and sweet her parting face
Immortal is an ample word
The jay his castanet has struck
Despair's advantage is achieved
A wind that rose though not a leaf
The pedigree of honey
The going from a world we know
It cant be "summer"!
What would I give to see his face?
Not sickness stains the brave
Back from the cordial grave I drag thee
A wind that rose though not a leaf
Oh what a grace is this
Immortal is an ample word
Two were immortal twice
No notice gave she but a change
An honest tear
The mushroom is the elf of plants
Where ships of purple gently toss
How soft his prison is
I've known a heaven like a tent
Bereaved of all I went abroad
We play at paste
A word is dead when it is said
I learned at least what home could be
God permits industrious angels
Except the smaller size
'Twas my one glory
If I should cease to bring a rose
The savior must have been
The thrill came slowly like a boon for
Ourselves were wed one summer - dear
There is a word
They called me to the window, for
Not to discover weakness is
The morns are meeker than they were
Experiment to me
'Twas crisis - All the length had passed
Ideals are the fairy oil
A throe opon the features
It is dead - find it
We miss a kinsman more
Her breast is fit for pearls
Success is counted sweetest
Because 'twas riches I could own
You'll know it as you know 'tis noon
The soul unto itself
To my small hearth his fire came
If wrecked opon the wharf of thought
The fascinating chill that music leaves
To my quick ear the leaves conferred
The heaven vests for each
They wont frown always - some sweet day
Where every bird is bold to go
Some days retired from the rest
We met as sparks - diverging flints
The props assist the house
No other can reduce
God gave a loaf to every bird
Through the dark sod as education
All men for honor hardest work
We like March - his shoes are purple
The face in evanescence lain
She hideth her the last
Go slow, my soul, to feed thyself
Immured in heaven!
There are two Mays
'Twas later when the summer went
Remorse is memory awake
Suspense is hostiler than death
When memory is full
How brittle are the piers
The bobolink is gone - the rowdy of the meadow
The pretty rain from those sweet eaves
Knows how to forget!
Unworthy of her breast
The infinite a sudden guest
Did the harebell loose her girdle
A train went through a burial gate
To hear an oriole sing
Exultation is the going
Knock with tremor
