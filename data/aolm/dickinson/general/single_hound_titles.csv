On my volcano grows the grass, --
Had this one day not been,
The inundation of the Spring
"Heavenly Father," take to thee
For Death, -- or rather
Lightly stepped a yellow star
To the staunch Dust we safe commit thee;
Her "Last Poems"--
The Moon upon her fluent route
Dropped into the
His Cheek is his Biographer --
Love reckons by itself alone,
So set its sun in thee,
I showed her heights she never saw --
No matter where the Saints abide,
To tell the beauty would decrease,
"Sown in dishonor?"
The Sea said "Come" to the Brook,
Glowing is her Bonnet,
'Twas comfort in her dying room
This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies,
Like some old fashioned miracle
All I may, if small,
Who is it seeks my pillow nights?
To love thee, year by year,
To see her is a picture,
The incidents of Love
The treason of an accent
A little over Jordan,
Who were "the Father and the Son"
Those final Creatures, -- who they are --
In Winter, in my room,
Not any sunny tone
Summer begins to have the look,
Speech is a sympton of affection,
The sweets of Pillage can be known
Distance is not the realm of Fox,
That she forgot me was the least,
How destitute is he
Just so, Jesus raps -- He does not weary -
That Love is all there is,
Dust is the only secret,
To this apartment deep
Follow wise Orion
The Ones that disappeared are back,
Forever cherished be the tree,
These are the days that Reindeer love
"Remember me," implored the Thief --
Ambition cannot find him,
The luxury to apprehend
Safe Despair it is that raves,
Crisis is sweet and, set the Heart
No romance sold unto,
I send two Sunsets --
Some Days retired from the rest
Some Days retired from the rest
A cap of lead across the sky
If what we could were what we would --
No other can reduce
Adventure most unto itself
A little madness in the Spring
So, from the mould,
The props assist the house
The gleam of an heroic act,
The long sigh of the Frog
I can't tell you, but you feel it --
One Sister have I in our house,
Perception of an
Witchcraft has not a pedigree,
Fame is a fickle food
"Morning" means "Milking" to the Farmer,
Beauty crowds me till I die,
The Duties of the Wind are few --
March is the month of expectation,
The butterfly obtains
She died at play,
The right to perish might be thought
Exhilaration is the Breeze
Except the smaller size, no Lives are round,
To be alive is power,
The Winds drew off
We spy the Forests and the Hills,
I Never told the buried gold
I think that the root of the Wind is Water,
Reverse cannot befall that fine Prosperity
The Soul that hath a Guest,
When Etna basks and purrs,
Nature is what we see,
Glory is that bright tragic thing,
The missing All prevented me
Ah, Teneriffe!
Peril as a possession
So gay a flower bereaved the mind
The Soul's superior instants
Bloom upon the Mountain, stated,
The largest fire ever known
Two lengths has every day,
There is another Loneliness
Of this is Day composed --
His mind, of man a secret makes,
Of Death the sharpest function,
Down Time's quaint stream
The suburbs of a secret
The Hills erect their purple heads,
The blunder is to estimate, --
The Future never spoke,
There is a solitude of space,
The difference between despair
I bet with every Wind that blew, till Nature in chagrin
My Wheel is in the dark, --
Papa above!
I see thee better in the dark,
Like brooms of steel
A prompt, executive Bird is the Jay,
Today or this noon
Devil, had he fidelity,
Of so divine a loss
Candor, my tepid Friend,
Low at my problem bending,
Not when we know
Elijah's wagon knew no thill,
If pain for peace prepares,
Eden is that old fashioned House
I did not reach thee,
The Face we choose to miss,
The healed Heart shows its shallow scar
If I could tell how glad I was,
No Autumn's intercepting chill
We should not mind so small a flower,
The Look of Thee, what is it like?
The overtakelessness of those
The feet of people walking home
Volcanoes be in Sicily
Her Grace is all she has,
To pile like Thunder to its close,
All circumstances are the frame
Too cold is this
Immured in Heaven! What a Cell!
I fit for them,
Not one by Heaven defrauded stay,
I'm thinking of that other morn,
I watched her face to see which way
The Stars are old, that stood for me --
