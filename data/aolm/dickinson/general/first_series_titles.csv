The daisy follows soft the sun,
I never lost as much but twice,
EMANCIPATION
If I shouldn't be alive
LOST
It was too late for man,
SUCCESS
Our share of night to bear,
ALONG THE POTOMAC
Death is a dialogue between
Except to heaven, she is nought;
I never saw a moor,
I reason, earth is short,
SUMMER SHOWER
The pedigree of honey
THE BOOK OF MARTYRS
I asked no other thing,
Much madness is divinest sense
DAWN
A SERVICE OF SONG
PSALM OF THE DAY
The bustle in a house
REFUGE
The last night that she lived,
I went to thank her,
Look back on time with kindly eyes,
SUMMER'S ARMIES
PURPLE CLOVER
The heart asks pleasure first,
THE LONELY HOUSE
THE WIFE
APOTHEOSIS
To fight aloud is very brave,
IN A LIBRARY
THE SEA OF SUNSET
The bee is not afraid of me,
A train went through a burial gate,
I've seen a dying eye
THE FIRST LESSON
THE HEMLOCK
DYING
"TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS."
WHY?
As children bid the guest good-night,
PROOF
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I taste a liquor never brewed,
THE MYSTERY OF PAIN
Glee! The great storm is over!
WITH A FLOWER
Angels in the early morning
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?
I died for beauty, but was scarce
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?
BECLOUDED
REAL
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
MAY-FLOWER.
A BOOK
ALMOST
A wounded deer leaps highest,
I had no time to hate, because
New feet within my garden go,
THE BEE
THE CHARIOT
THE FUNERAL
INDIAN SUMMER
TOO LATE
TWO WORLDS
THE OUTLET
SURRENDER
If you were coming in the fall,
IN VAIN
So bashful when I spied her,
ASTRA CASTRA
AUTUMN
One dignity delays for all,
'T was later when the summer went
RESURGAM
SUSPENSE
TRANSPLANTED
Whether my bark went down at sea,
UNRETURNING
Have you got a brook in your little heart,
Alter? When the hills do.
She went as quiet as the dew
DEATH AND LIFE
There's a certain slant of light,
PLAYMATES
Safe in their alabaster chambers,
THE MOUNTAIN
EXCLUSION
Belshazzar had a letter,
RENUNCIATION
LOVE'S BAPTISM
The brain within its groove
THE SECRET
A DAY
On this long storm the rainbow rose,
To know just how he suffered would be dear;
THE WIND
SETTING SAIL
THE GRASS
APOCALYPSE
BEQUEST
MINE
RESURRECTION
A little road not made of man,
FROM THE CHRYSALIS
The butterfly's assumption-gown,
ROUGE GAGNE
ROUGE ET NOIR
Sleep is supposed to be,
I shall know why, when time is over,
