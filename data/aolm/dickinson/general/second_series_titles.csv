Talk with prudence to a beggar
REMORSE
THE LOST JEWEL
THE ORIOLE
Experiment to me
MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE
IN SHADOW
I'm nobody!  Who are you?
What if I say I shall not wait?
TIME'S LESSON
SIGHT
When I hoped I feared,
A shady friend for torrid days
The nearest dream recedes, unrealized.
THE ORIOLE'S SECRET
He put the belt around my life,
I have no life but this,
CHOICE
The moon is distant from the sea,
I bring an unaccustomed wine
MY ROSE
THE GOAL
DEED
Undue significance a starving man attaches
Except the heaven had come so near,
THE LOVERS
THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY
HOPE
MOTHER NATURE
OUT OF THE MORNING
THE BLUEBIRD
THE WHITE HEAT
In lands I never saw, they say,
Faith is a fine invention
THE SHELTER
Portraits are to daily faces
Heart not so heavy as mine,
Delight becomes pictorial
DAY'S PARLOR
I found the phrase to every thought
THE SLEEPING FLOWERS
We play at paste,
APRIL
At half-past three a single bird
THE SHOW
I many times thought peace had come,
THE DUEL
I have not told my garden yet,
THE JOURNEY
TWO VOYAGERS
GOSSIP
It can't be summer,  that got through;
It was not death, for I stood up,
What inn is this
As imperceptibly as grief
Nature rarer uses yellow
Who robbed the woods,
A COUNTRY BURIAL
THE BATTLE-FIELD.
If anybody's friend be dead,
I read my sentence steadily,
SIMPLICITY
BY THE SEA
OLD-FASHIONED.
STORM
A death-blow is a life-blow to some
FOLLOWING
There is a shame of nobleness
The only ghost I ever saw
THE WlND'S VISIT.
THE SNAKE
IN THE GARDEN
The one that could repeat the summer day
Some, too fragile for winter winds,
TRIUMPH
MEMORIALS
I noticed people disappeared,
EPITAPH
A TEMPEST
THE SPIDER
I know a place where summer strives
THE SEA
Morns like these we parted;
Pompless no life can pass away;
As by the dead we love to sit,
A THUNDER-STORM.
THE BLUE JAY
THE MUSHROOM
I think just how my shape will rise
I lived on dread; to those who know
If I should die,
THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE
THE STORM
Let down the bars, O Death!
WITH FLOWERS
I went to heaven,
At least to pray is left, is left.
She sweeps with many-colored brooms,
GHOSTS
Lay this laurel on the one
AT LENGTH
SUNSET
Going to heaven!
Their height in heaven comforts not,
Essential oils are wrung:
NOVEMBER
THE JUGGLER OF DAY
GONE
A throe upon the features
SAVED
REQUIEM
MY CRICKET
THE SNOW
GOING
Frequently the woods are pink,
PROBLEMS
FRINGED GENTIAN
VOID
PRECEDENCE
VANISHED
TILL THE END
SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES
Like mighty footlights burned the red
THE RAT
The soul unto itself
RETURNING
A charm invests a face
Is Heaven a physician?
THE TEST
TRIUMPHANT
POSSESSION
A thought went up my mind to-day
The thought beneath so slight a film
To learn the transport by the pain,
This merit hath the worst,
THE RETURN
Wild nights! Wild nights!
HUNGER
Surgeons must be very careful
THE SUN'S WOOING
THE ROBIN
I gained it so,
THE RAILWAY TRAIN
A poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
AT HOME
Unto my books so good to turn
THE PREACHER
SECRETS
THE CONTRACT
ENOUGH
A PRAYER
I know that he exists
THE MARTYRS
PRAYER
Your riches taught me poverty.
Victory comes late,
THE HUMMING-BIRD.
Good night! which put the candle out?
MELODIES UNHEARD
ESCAPE
TOO MUCH
THE LETTER
SHIPWRECK
The way I read a letter 's this:
CALLED BACK
COMPENSATION
