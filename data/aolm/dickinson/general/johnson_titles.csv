The Sun is one -- and on the Tare
I took one Draught of Life --
Brother of Ingots -- Ah Peru --
Love can do all but raise the Dead
You said that I "was Great" -- one Day --
Lest they should come -- is all my fear
The event was directly behind Him
A poor -- torn heart -- a tattered heart --
The right to perish might be tho't
Some Rainbow -- coming from the Fair!
Fame of Myself, to justify,
Distance -- is not the Realm of Fox
The Face we choose to miss --
The Grace -- Myself -- might not obtain --
The Malay -- took the Pearl --
I showed her Hights she never saw --
Doubt Me! My Dim Companion!
Herein a Blossom lies --
Put up my lute!
Wild Nights -- Wild Nights!
As One does Sickness over
Too little way the House must lie
Between My Country -- and the Others --
A Coffin -- is a small Domain,
When Katie walks, this simple pair accompany her side,
If He dissolve -- then -- there is nothing -- more --
These are the Nights that Beetles love --
Some -- Work for Immortality --
I read my sentence -- steadily --
Experiment escorts us last --
Undue Significance a starving man attaches
I lost a World -- the other day!
The Service without Hope --
The saddest noise, the sweetest noise,
For this -- accepted Breath --
The spry Arms of the Wind
Renunciation -- is a piercing Virtue --
My Worthiness is all my Doubt --
A Mine there is no Man would own
Where every bird is bold to go
With thee, in the Desert --
We lose -- because we win --
Her spirit rose to such a hight
Nobody knows this little Rose --
"And with what body do they come?" --
He lived the Life of Ambush
We wear our sober Dresses when we die,
Above Oblivion's Tide there is a Pier
Climbing to reach the costly Hearts
Left in immortal Youth
I've seen a Dying Eye
I cannot want it more --
Which is the best -- the Moon or the Crescent?
One Crucifixion is recorded -- only
When a Lover is a Beggar
An ignorance a Sunset
To fill a Gap
From his slim Palace in the Dust
Lain in Nature -- so suffice us
The Heart has many Doors --
A Pang is more conspicuous in Spring
To the bright east she flies,
A faded Boy -- in sallow Clothes
Could that sweet Darkness where they dwell
Snow flakes.
The Savior must have been
All these my banners be.
Growth of Man -- like Growth of Nature --
The Rose did caper on her cheek --
Which misses most,
There is another Loneliness
His Bill is clasped -- his Eye forsook --
Remorse -- is Memory -- awake --
On this long storm the Rainbow rose --
That Love is all there is,
As if some little Arctic flower
Forget! The Lady with the Amulet
How fleet -- how indiscreet an one --
This that would greet -- an hour ago --
I never felt at Home -- Below --
If What we Could -- were what we would --
Tell all the Truth but tell it slant --
I think just how my shape will rise --
I Came to buy a smile -- today --
Had I not This, or This, I said,
Snow beneath whose chilly softness
What shall I do when the Summer troubles --
Why -- do they shut Me out of Heaven?
Experience is the Angled Road
How happy I was if I could forget
Read -- Sweet -- how others -- strove --
The only Ghost I ever saw
Could -- I do more -- for Thee --
Love -- thou art high --
The Day grew small, surrounded tight
Life, and Death, and Giants --
Because I could not stop for Death --
A full fed Rose on meals of Tint
If pain for peace prepares
The Sun retired to a cloud
I never hear the word "escape"
The gleam of an heroic Act
As old as Woe --
"Lethe" in my flower,
"Tomorrow" -- whose location
I many times thought Peace had come
How dare the robins sing,
The worthlessness of Earthly things
Take all away --
My life closed twice before its close;
How fits his Umber Coat
If all the griefs I am to have
The long sigh of the Frog
Life -- is what we make it --
The overtakelessness of those
Papa above!
The butterfly obtains
She died at play,
No matter -- now -- Sweet --
The Props assist the House
Lest any doubt that we are glad that they were born Today
God is indeed a jealous God --
I never lost as much but twice,
The Sunrise runs for Both --
She dealt her pretty words like Blades --
What I see not, I better see --
'Twas just this time, last year, I died.
The Outer -- from the Inner
The lonesome for they know not What --
Many a phrase has the English language --
Fitter to see Him, I may be
On that dear Frame the Years had worn
The Admirations -- and Contempts -- of time --
Peace is a fiction of our Faith --
The Chemical conviction
The Court is far away --
It cant be "Summer"!
A House upon the Hight --
The Color of the Grave is Green --
It might be lonelier
Ended, ere it begun --
Sweet hours have perished here;
We dont cry -- Tim and I,
The Summer that we did not prize,
If I should'nt be alive
The largest Fire ever known
So the Eyes accost -- and sunder
Never for Society
The last Night that She lived
Whether they have forgotten
By such and such an offering
The Road to Paradise is plain,
There is a morn by men unseen --
Love is done when Love's begun,
The Dandelion's pallid tube
From all the Jails the Boys and Girls
Some Arrows slay but whom they strike --
His oriental heresies
How slow the Wind --
The Body grows without --
I cross till I am weary
Through lane it lay -- thro' bramble --
Tried always and Condemned by thee
Winter is good -- his Hoar Delights
I think that the Root of the Wind is Water --
The Martyr Poets -- did not tell --
Not One by Heaven defrauded stay --
'Tis One by One -- the Father counts --
There is a Shame of Nobleness --
Abraham to kill him
Of Death I try to think like this --
My wheel is in the dark!
Forever honored be the Tree
Oh give it Motion -- deck it sweet
I had been hungry, all the Years --
Pass to thy Rendezvous of Light,
On that specific Pillow
Not seeing, still we know --
We shall find the Cube of the Rainbow.
I had a guinea golden --
The Face in evanescence lain
Before the ice is in the pools --
The vastest earthly Day
It dropped so low -- in my Regard --
Between the form of Life and Life
The murmuring of Bees, has ceased
My Soul -- accused me -- And I quailed --
I've heard an Organ talk, sometimes --
Let me not thirst with this Hock at my Lip,
Morning -- is the place for Dew --
Those final Creatures, -- who they are --
Myself can read the Telegrams
How many Flowers fail in Wood --
The first Day's Night had come --
I had not minded -- Walls --
Could I -- then -- shut the door --
You're right -- "the way is narrow" --
And this of all my Hopes
The Hollows round His eager Eyes
The Lady feeds Her little Bird
Till Death -- is narrow Loving --
He who in Himself believes --
What if I say I shall not wait!
A single Screw of Flesh
Dreams -- are well -- but Waking's better,
It feels a shame to be Alive --
I had no time to Hate --
Fairer through Fading -- as the Day
I hav'nt told my garden yet --
Drowning is not so pitiful
Some Days retired from the rest
Strong Draughts of Their Refreshing Minds
Suspense -- is Hostiler than Death --
The Work of Her that went,
Exultation is the going
The Blunder is in estimate
The Judge is like the Owl --
"Sown in dishonor"!
The ones that disappeared are back
The Treason of an accent
If ever the lid gets off my head
Gathered into the Earth,
No man saw awe, nor to his house
How know it from a Summer's Day?
Lift it -- with the Feathers
I sued the News -- yet feared -- the News
Rearrange a "Wife's" affection!
A Saucer holds a Cup
High from the earth I heard a bird;
Witchcraft has not a Pedigree
After a hundred years
Like her the Saints retire,
A Thought went up my mind today --
The World -- feels Dusty
Through what transports of Patience
The wind drew off
So from the mould
The Zeroes -- taught us -- Phosphorus --
Sometimes with the Heart
Glowing is her Bonnet,
'Tis customary as we part
It was given to me by the Gods --
The Manner of it's Death
The Heart has narrow Banks
I hide myself within my flower,
This is a Blossom of the Brain --
As Frost is best conceived
Love -- is anterior to Life --
Did we disobey Him?
This Merit hath the worst --
He put the Belt around my life --
'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,
A Tongue -- to tell Him I am true!
We -- Bee and I -- live by the quaffing --
Take Your Heaven further on --
I've nothing else -- to bring, You know --
The Mountains -- grow unnoticed --
Some Wretched creature, savior take
Like Men and Women Shadows walk
The Birds reported from the South --
Were nature mortal lady
I shall know why -- when Time is over --
My Cocoon tightens -- Colors teaze --
How many times these low feet staggered --
You cannot make Remembrance grow
The competitions of the sky
If recollecting were forgetting,
What tenements of clover
The fascinating chill that music leaves
Morns like these -- we parted --
Warm in her Hand these accents lie
Trust in the Unexpected --
Some such Butterfly be seen
Distrustful of the Gentian --
That short -- potential stir
Meeting by Accident,
Candor -- my tepid friend --
To be forgot by thee
I reckon -- when I count at all --
We never know we go when we are going --
No ladder needs the bird but skies
The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings --
His little Hearse like Figure
No Brigadier throughout the Year
There comes a warning like a spy
We learned the Whole of Love --
I took my Power in my Hand --
My Wars are laid away in Books --
Surprise is like a thrilling -- pungent --
A sepal, petal, and a thorn
To break so vast a Heart
The Black Berry -- wears a Thorn in his side --
So has a Daisy vanished
The way Hope builds his House
A Bee his burnished Carriage
Garlands for Queens, may be --
The Thrill came slowly like a Boon for
Mine Enemy is growing old --
What shall I do -- it whimpers so --
Of the Heart that goes in, and closes the Door
Poor little Heart!
Fame is a bee.
The Crickets sang
Four Trees -- upon a solitary Acre --
One Blessing had I than the rest
None who saw it ever told it
Jesus! thy Crucifix
There's been a Death, in the Opposite House,
God permits industrious Angels --
What Soft -- Cherubic Creatures --
Sunset at Night -- is natural --
I breathed enough to take the Trick --
It bloomed and dropt, a Single Noon --
This -- is the land -- the Sunset washes --
The Sunset stopped on Cottages
His Feet are shod with Gauze --
The first Day that I was a Life
I learned -- at least -- what Home could be --
The Red -- Blaze -- is the Morning --
How far is it to Heaven?
Triumph -- may be of several kinds --
This is my letter to the World
"Speech" -- is a prank of Parliament --
A throe upon the features --
Speech is one symptom of Affection
I cant tell you -- but you feel it --
There is a solitude of space
Rests at Night
Tell as a Marksman -- were forgotten
A little East of Jordan,
When Etna basks and purrs
With sweetness unabated
You've seen Balloons set -- Hav'nt You?
Her face was in a bed of hair,
Death warrants are supposed to be
Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it,
The Flake the Wind exasperate
I'd rather recollect a setting
Forbidden Fruit a flavor has
Had I known that the first was the last
Alter! When the Hills do --
Summer laid her simple Hat
Oh, honey of an hour,
How many schemes may die
The Day undressed -- Herself --
A first Mute Coming --
Ourselves we do inter with sweet derision.
That she forgot me was the least
Who never lost, are unprepared
They talk as slow as Legends grow
My God -- He sees thee --
Success is counted sweetest
Sweet -- safe -- Houses --
I tie my Hat -- I crease my Shawl --
I cannot be ashamed
A Man may make a Remark --
There's a certain Slant of light,
It is an honorable Thought
What did They do since I saw Them?
When I have seen the Sun emerge
One Life of so much Consequence!
A Weight with Needles on the pounds --
The Winters are so short --
It is dead -- Find it --
Teach Him -- when He makes the names --
Her sovreign People
The Lamp burns sure -- within --
You taught me Waiting with Myself --
The waters chased him as he fled,
We do not know the time we lose --
Is it true, dear Sue?
That this should feel the need of Death
My Life had stood -- a Loaded Gun --
The earth has many keys.
A transport one cannot contain
A train went through a burial gate,
Taking up the fair Ideal,
He was weak, and I was strong -- then --
When I hoped, I recollect
The Robin is a Gabriel
It's all I have to bring today --
Facts by our side are never sudden
When Roses cease to bloom, Sir,
Not with a Club, the Heart is broken
I had no Cause to be awake --
The Brain, within it's Groove
The Notice that is called the Spring
The stem of a departed Flower
The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants --
Morning is due to all --
Society for me my misery
By homely gift and hindered Words
Her Losses make our Gains ashamed --
The Life that tied too tight escapes
The Spirit lasts -- but in what mode --
Delight's Despair at setting
The Butterfly upon the Sky,
She hideth Her the last --
This dirty -- little Heart
Recollect the Face of me
I fear a Man of frugal Speech --
Summer for thee, grant I may be
All that I do
She slept beneath a tree --
'Tis whiter than an Indian Pipe --
The Skies cant keep their secret!
The Moon is distant from the Sea --
Elysium is as far as to
One and One -- are One --
"Faith" is a fine invention
Too happy Time dissolves itself
There is a strength in proving that it can be bourne
No Bobolink -- reverse His Singing
Drama's Vitallest Expression is the Common Day
She sweeps with many -- colored Brooms --
The Bird did prance -- the Bee did play --
The reticent volcano keeps
The Sun -- lust touched the Morning --
A Spider sewed at Night
[Sh]should you but fail [at] --  Sea --
A Murmur in the Trees -- to note --
I pay -- in Satin Cash --
Where Ships of Purple -- gently toss --
Crisis is a Hair
A solemn thing -- it was -- I said --
Of Tolling Bell I ask the cause?
Good Night! Which Put the Candle out?
Sweet, to have had them lost
Faith -- is the Pierless Bridge
A Door just opened on a street --
God made a little Gentian --
So well that I can live without --
Ambition cannot find him.
Of so divine a Loss
These are the days that Reindeer love
A Lady red -- amid the Hill
Summer begins to have the look
Out of sight? What of that?
In thy long Paradise of Light
Soul, take thy risk,
The Beggar Lad -- dies early --
One crown that no one seeks
Of their peculiar light
He was my host -- he was my guest,
Dreams are the subtle Dower
Let Us play Yesterday --
They might not need me -- yet they might --
Flowers -- Well -- if anybody
Because He loves Her
"Secrets" is a daily word
In lands I never saw -- they say
It was a quiet seeming Day --
I know of people in the Grave
Spurn the temerity --
My nosegays are for Captives --
Wolfe demanded during dying
Judgment is justest
The pretty Rain from those sweet Eaves
We should not mind so small a flower --
A Deed knocks first at Thought
Fame is a fickle food
By a flower -- By a letter --
Pain -- has an Element of Blank --
You left me -- Sire -- two Legacies --
The Frost was never seen --
'Tis not that Dying hurts us so --
Those fair -- fictitious People --
Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,
If you were coming in the Fall,
I would not paint -- a picture --
One Year ago -- jots what?
The Definition of Beauty is
How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,
Apology for Her
Did We abolish Frost
The Fingers of the Light
Twice had Summer her fair Verdure
Always Mine!
Rehearsal to Ourselves
Funny -- to be a Century --
I felt my life with both my hands
My River runs to thee --
Further in Summer than the Birds
I'm the little "Heart's Ease"!
A Plated Life -- diversified
Not so the infinite Relations -- Below
Not to discover weakness is
A Light exists in Spring
So give me back to Death --
Before you thought of Spring
No Life can pompless pass away --
Their Barricade against the Sky
Belshazzar had a Letter --
The Bobolink is gone -- the Rowdy of the Meadow --
Three times -- we parted -- Breath -- and I --
The Bird her punctual music brings
To flee from memory
Unto my Books -- so good to turn --
You'll find -- it when you try to die --
Not knowing when the Dawn will come,
Not any higher stands the Grave
I see thee better -- in the Dark --
Dominion lasts until obtained --
There are two Mays
Safe Despair it is that raves --
The Spider holds a Silver Ball
Expanse cannot be lost --
Not at Home to Callers
There is a pain -- so utter --
Time's wily Chargers will not wait
The Sweets of Pillage, can be known
The pedigree of Honey
One thing of it we borrow
Still own thee -- still thou art
The Soul should always stand ajar
This quiet Dust was Gentlemen and Ladies
Expectation -- is Contentment --
Somewhat, to hope for,
Ah, Necromancy Sweet!
Paradise is of the option.
Tho' my destiny be Fustian --
They leave us with the Infinite.
'Twas the old -- road -- through pain --
Impossibility, like Wine
I saw no Way -- The Heavens were stitched --
The Stimulus, beyond the Grave
Finite -- to fail, but infinite to Venture --
When One has given up One's life
Were it but Me that gained the Hight --
A Mien to move a Queen --
Gratitude -- is not the mention
It's like the Light --
You know that Portrait in the Moon --
It was not Death, for I stood up,
We play at Paste --
I envy Seas, whereon He rides --
All the letters I can write
Bereavement in their death to feel
The Past is such a curious Creature
Artists wrestled here!
Endanger it, and the Demand
Fortitude incarnate
So much Summer
Conscious am I in my Chamber,
Whose cheek is this?
To earn it by disdaining it
In Winter in my Room
Sexton! My Master's sleeping here.
How brittle are the Piers
I did not reach Thee
How lonesome the Wind must feel Nights --
Many cross the Rhine
Praise it -- 'tis dead --
So much of Heaven has gone from Earth
Have you got a Brook in your little heart,
These held their Wick above the West --
[stanza
As Watchers hang upon the East,
Hope is a strange invention --
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,
Lightly stepped a yellow star
The inundation of the Spring
Her breast is fit for pearls,
The Voice that stands for Floods to me
I see thee clearer for the Grave
With Pinions of Disdain
One dignity delays for all --
So I pull my Stockings off
A little Road -- not made of Man --
Of Being is a Bird
I bet with every Wind that blew
There came a Day at Summer's full,
'Twas my one Glory --
The face I carry with me -- last --
He touched me, so I live to know
The Soul has Bandaged moments --
Each Second is the last
'Tis so appalling -- it exhilarates --
The Province of the Saved
Unto like Story -- Trouble has enticed me --
Be Mine the Doom --
Dying at my music!
For largest Woman's Heart I knew --
To die -- without the Dying
When the Astronomer stops seeking
Perhaps I asked too large --
Not probable -- The barest Chance --
I have never seen 'Volcanoes' --
A feather from the Whippowil
Despair's advantage is achieved
The Veins of other Flowers
I had a daily Bliss
She went as quiet as the Dew
Lest this be Heaven indeed
This Bauble was preferred of Bees --
Back from the cordial Grave I drag thee
To see the Summer Sky
To my small Hearth His fire came --
Oh Future! thou secreted peace
One of the ones that Midas touched
To her derided Home
I worked for chaff and earning Wheat
The Lassitudes of Contemplation
Longing is like the Seed
They shut me up in Prose --
Of nearness to her sundered Things
The Lilac is an ancient shrub
The Trees like Tassels -- hit -- and swung --
The Beggar at the Door for Fame
Elijah's Wagon knew no thill
It would have starved a Gnat --
There came a Wind like a Bugle --
Confirming All who analyze
He ate and drank the precious Words --
My Portion is Defeat -- today --
A little overflowing word
As from the earth the light Balloon
We talked with each other about each other
Apparently with no surprise
Spring comes on the World --
No Notice gave She, but a Change --
Her Grace is all she has --
All overgrown by cunning moss,
There is a Zone whose even Years
Just lost, when I was saved!
She staked her Feathers -- Gained an Arc --
At last, to be identified!
When Night is almost done --
A happy lip -- breaks sudden --
The Hills in Purple syllables
I send Two Sunsets --
I sing to use the Waiting
Spring is the Period
Aurora is the effort
The Doomed -- regard the Sunrise
The Sun is gay or stark
'Tis true -- They shut me in the Cold --
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
Like Flowers, that heard the news of Dews,
She sights a Bird -- she chuckles --
I know a place where Summer strives
Nor Mountain hinder Me
As if I asked a common Alms,
A Prison gets to be a friend --
We introduce ourselves
Because my Brook is fluent
I think To Live -- may be a Bliss
The rainbow never tells me
Who never wanted -- maddest Joy
I watched her face to see which way
'Twas fighting for his Life he was --
Heart, not so heavy as mine
The Gentian has a parched Corolla --
Nature can do no more
Water, is taught by thirst.
Lay this Laurel on the One
A something in a summer's Day
The Butterfly's Numidian Gown
To fight aloud, is very brave --
Long Years apart -- can make no
I bring an unaccustomed wine
It sounded as if the Streets were running
Me from Myself -- to banish --
Whatever it is -- she has tried it --
The Sea said "Come" to the Brook --
The name -- of it -- is "Autumn" --
On my volcano grows the Grass
A soft Sea washed around the House
A darting fear -- a pomp -- a tear --
One Joy of so much anguish
His mind of man, a secret makes
Went up a year this evening!
Go not too near a House of Rose --
Better -- than Music! For I -- who heard it --
He parts Himself -- like Leaves --
I heard, as if I had no Ear
Before I got my eye put out
The Grass so little has to do --
I'll tell you how the Sun rose --
The first We knew of Him was Death --
I cannot buy it -- 'tis not sold --
Banish Air from Air --
Which is best? Heaven --
The Drop, that wrestles in the Sea --
They ask but our Delight
Of Bronze -- and Blaze --
Mine -- by the Right of the White Election!
God is a distant -- stately Lover --
My Reward for Being, was This.
I never saw a Moor --
One Day is there of the Series
Two -- were immortal twice --
I've dropped my Brain -- My Soul is numb --
Dying! Dying in the night!
Portraits are to daily faces
Joy to have merited the Pain --
Mama never forgets her birds,
I watched the Moon around the House
Circumference thou Bride of Awe
How destitute is he
Talk not to me of Summer Trees
A Route of Evanescence
I rose -- because He sank --
White as an Indian Pipe
The Butterfly's Assumption Gown
Of Brussels -- it was not --
Witchcraft was hung, in History,
The Mountains stood in Haze --
'T'is not the swaying frame we miss,
Few, yet enough,
The Way to know the Bobolink
Where Roses would not dare to go,
The Suburbs of a Secret
He found my Being -- set it up --
Dont put up my Thread  Needle --
Silence is all we dread.
We knew not that we were to live --
The Jay his Castanet has struck
They called me to the Window, for
His voice decrepit was with Joy --
A Flower will not trouble her, it has so small a Foot,
A Wounded Deer -- leaps highest --
Wait till the Majesty of Death
On a Columnar Self --
I play at Riches -- to appease
A little Bread -- a crust -- a crumb --
The Opening and the Close
It was a quiet way --
The Luxury to apprehend
It will be Summer -- eventually.
The Day that I was crowned
Because the Bee may blameless hum
I'm sorry for the Dead -- Today --
How the old Mountains drip with Sunset
The Robin's my Criterion for Tune --
To own the Art within the Soul
Too scanty 'twas to die for you,
Falsehood of Thee could I suppose
The nearest Dream recedes -- unrealized --
A Moth the hue of this
There are two Ripenings -- one -- of sight --
I cannot dance upon my Toes --
Her little Parasol to lift
Beauty -- be not caused -- It Is --
At least -- to pray -- is left -- is left --
Not that he goes -- we love him more
Angels, in the early morning
He went by sleep that drowsy route
Such are the inlets of the mind --
As by the dead we love to sit,
Are Friends Delight or Pain?
Of Yellow was the outer Sky
A Sparrow took a Slice of Twig
I dwell in Possibility --
I could suffice for Him, I knew --
Immortal is an ample word
She laid her docile Crescent down
Besides the Autumn poets sing
In many and reportless places
For each extatic instant
The Fact that Earth is Heaven --
I bring an unaccustomed wine
Whose Pink career may have a close
'Houses' -- so the Wise Men tell me --
How much the present moment means
Power is a familiar growth --
Without this -- there is nought --
We like March.
The immortality she gave
He preached upon "Breadth" till it argued him narrow --
If this is "fading"
Size circumscribes -- it has no room
No Romance sold unto
Glory is that bright tragic thing
My friend must be a Bird --
A Dew sufficed itself --
Not any sunny tone
South Winds jostle them --
The fairest Home I ever knew
Her smile was shaped like other smiles --
Within my Garden, rides a Bird
Myself was formed -- a Carpenter --
The Juggler's Hat her Country is --
Some keep the Sabbath going to Church --
She rose as high as His Occasion
Uncertain lease -- developes lustre
I made slow Riches but my Gain
Bind me -- I still can sing --
I got so I could hear his name --
A Clock stopped --
Superfluous were the Sun
Is Bliss then, such Abyss,
From Cocoon forth a Butterfly
The Robin is the One
How sick -- to wait -- in any place -- but thine --
Nature rarer uses Yellow
Who Court obtain within Himself
Given in Marriage unto Thee
I cannot meet the Spring unmoved --
The Sun went down -- no Man looked on --
To learn the Transport by the Pain --
A fuzzy fellow, without feet,
How soft a Caterpillar steps --
Is it too late to touch you, Dear?
His Cheek is his Biographer --
A World made penniniless by that departure
Estranged from Beauty -- none can be --
A still -- Volcano -- Life --
To pile like Thunder to it's close
The ecstasy to guess
Had this one Day not been,
Our journey had advanced --
Immured in Heaven!
We shun it ere it comes,
The Night was wide, and furnished scant
The farthest Thunder that I heard
I cried at Pity -- not at Pain --
Declaiming Waters none may dread --
Like Brooms of Steel
In falling Timbers buried --
It troubled me as once I was --
Sunset that screens, reveals --
The Butterfly in honored Dust
Fame is the one that does not stay --
A Sloop of Amber slips away
"Heavenly Father" -- take to thee
The Sun in reining to the West
I thought the Train would never come --
'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy!
I met a King this afternoon!
The Bustle in a House
A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
As willing lid o'er weary eye
A Sickness of this World it most occasions
Time feels so vast that were it not
Ample make this Bed --
She lay as if at play
'Tis Opposites -- entice --
After great pain, a formal feeling comes --
Best Things dwell out of Sight
That after Horror -- that 'twas us
If your Nerve, deny you --
Good to hide, and hear 'em hunt!
There is no Silence in the Earth -- so silent
Up Life's Hill with my little Bundle
There is a finished feeling
Of Tribulation -- these are They,
While Asters --
We pray -- to Heaven --
This World is not Conclusion.
No Crowd that has occurred
Summer has two Beginnings --
"They have not chosen me," he said,
Of this is Day composed
"Nature" is what we see --
Than Heaven more remote,
So bashful when I spied her!
Guest am I to have
Talk with prudence to a Beggar
The Show is not the Show
A Cap of Lead across the sky
I cannot live with You --
A long -- long Sleep -- A famous -- Sleep --
A word is dead
Risk is the Hair that holds the Tun
I suppose the time will come
Bring me the sunset in a cup,
After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside --
As Children bid the Guest "Good Night"
Could mortal lip divine
I shall not murmur if at last
March is the Month of Expectation.
If my Bark sink
I have no Life but this --
Of Nature I shall have enough
Some one prepared this mighty show
I had some things that I called mine --
That first Day, when you praised Me, Sweet,
A lane of Yellow led the eye
Great Caesar! Condescend
I should not dare to be so sad
Peril as a Possession
Within my reach!
She dwelleth in the Ground --
Dropped into the Ether Acre --
Step lightly on this narrow spot --
Her sweet Weight on my Heart a Night
To One denied to drink
Satisfaction -- is the Agent
A Bird came down the Walk --
My Garden -- like the Beach --
I knew that I had gained
Just so -- Jesus -- raps --
I was a Phebe -- nothing more --
The Soul selects her own Society --
Ribbons of the Year --
Two Butterflies went Out at Noon --
This was in the White of the Year --
To put this World down, like a Bundle --
As Sleigh Bells seem in summer
Escaping backward to perceive
If any sink, assure that this, now standing --
The Wind begun to knead the Grass --
The Morning after Wo --
Heaven is so far of the Mind
To this World she returned.
For every Bird a Nest --
Pain has but one Acquaintance
Musicians wrestle everywhere --
Such is the Force of Happiness --
Three Weeks passed since -- I had seen Her --
The Sky is low -- the Clouds are mean.
Grief is a Mouse --
A little Snow was here and there
The Road was lit with Moon and star --
Look back on Time, with kindly eyes --
Only God -- detect the Sorrow --
The Brain -- is wider than the Sky --
Morning that comes but once,
Glee -- The great storm is over --
We send the Wave to find the Wave --
There is no Frigate like a Book
I like to see it lap the Miles --
To interrupt His Yellow Plan
Who is it seeks my Pillow Nights --
While we were fearing it, it came --
Did you ever stand in a Cavern's Mouth --
'Twas later when the summer went
Though the great Waters sleep,
I cannot see my soul but know 'tis there
It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
Each that we lose takes part of us;
Their dappled importunity
At leisure is the Soul
When Bells stop ringing -- Church -- begins --
The Devil -- had he fidelity
The Tint I cannot take -- is best --
Whoever disenchants
Death is the supple Suitor
Count not that far that can be had,
Through the strait pass of suffering --
Severer Service of myself
Air has no Residence, no Neighbor,
You love me -- you are sure --
Reportless Subjects, to the Quick
Whose are the little beds, I asked
A precious -- mouldering pleasure -- 'tis --
Dying! To be afraid of thee
An Hour is a Sea
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?
I gained it so --
Purple -- is fashionable twice --
To hear an Oriole sing
Fame is the tint that Scholars leave
As the Starved Maelstrom laps the Navies
Partake as doth the Bee,
I tried to think a lonelier Thing
Like Some Old fashioned Miracle
How still the Bells in Steeples stand
The Wind did'nt come from the Orchard -- today --
It rises -- passes -- on our South
To make One's Toilette -- after Death
So glad we are -- a Stranger'd deem
Here, where the Daisies fit my Head
While it is alive
'Twas warm --  at first -- like Us --
Of all the Souls that stand create --
Remembrance has a Rear and Front --
Some things that fly there be --
Rather arid delight
To make Routine a Stimulus
One need not be a Chamber -- to be Haunted --
Whole Gulfs -- of Red, and Fleets -- of Red --
Will there really be a "Morning"?
A Word made Flesh is seldom
What Inn is this
The Ditch is dear to the Drunken man
Some we see no more, Tenements of Wonder
Perhaps they do not go so far
Like Rain it sounded till it curved
Bees are Black, with Gilt Surcingles --
Of Paradise' existence
A Field of Stubble, lying sere
Sweet Skepticism of the Heart ---
Who goes to dine must take his Feast
These are the days when Birds come back --
My Heart ran so to thee
As we pass Houses musing slow
I have a King, who does not speak --
Our own possessions -- though our own --
Of Glory not a Beam is left
In rags mysterious as these
"Remember me" implored the Thief!
Behold this little Bane --
Ah, Teneriffe!
The Future -- never spoke --
Somehow myself survived the Night
You love the Lord -- you cannot see --
Far from Love the Heavenly Father
The World -- stands -- solemner -- to me --
Bee! I'm expecting you!
This Chasm, Sweet, upon my life
"Morning" -- means "Milking" -- to the Farmer --
Nature -- sometimes sears a Sapling --
The Robin for the Crumb
Departed -- to the Judgment --
No Other can reduce
I'm Nobody! Who are you?
You cannot put a Fire out --
We'll pass without the parting
Finding is the first Act
Perhaps you think me stooping
I'm saying every day
Over and over, like a Tune --
The Only News I know
Except to Heaven, she is nought.
An altered look about the hills --
I could not drink it, Sweet,
Nature -- the Gentlest Mother is,
Just Once! Oh least Request!
If the foolish, call them "flowers" --
He scanned it -- staggered --
Bereaved of all, I went abroad --
A Counterfeit -- a Plated Person --
How good his Lava Bed,
Go thy great way!
Ourselves were wed one summer -- dear --
'Twas a long Parting -- but the time
Within that little Hive
The incidents of love
Not Sickness stains the Brave,
The Bone that has no Marrow,
What care the Dead, for Chanticleer --
We talked as Girls do --
Because that you are going
Empty my Heart, of Thee --
A Word dropped careless on a Page
The Spider as an Artist
I think I was enchanted
The Auctioneer of Parting
The Stars are old, that stood for me --
Quite empty, quite at rest,
Forever -- is composed of Nows --
A Letter is a joy of Earth --
The Lightning playeth -- all the while --
His Mind like Fabrics of the East
Your thoughts dont have words every day
Ashes denote that Fire was --
They have a little Odor -- that to me
God gave a Loaf to every Bird --
In Ebon Box, when years have flown
These are the Signs to Nature's Inns --
Some, too fragile for winter winds
All I may, if small,
The Murmur of a Bee
Although I put away his life --
Love reckons by itself -- alone --
Soto! Explore thyself!
I know lives, I could miss
Crumbling is not an instant's Act
We dream -- it is good we are dreaming --
I know some lonely Houses off the Road
The Sun and Moon must make their haste --
He outstripped Time with but a Bout,
Ideals are the Fairy Oil
I think the Hemlock likes to stand
He fumbles at your Soul
A Doubt if it be Us
I reason, Earth is short --
His Bill an Augur is
Civilization -- spurns -- the Leopard!
Trudging to Eden, looking backward,
I was the slightest in the House --
The Love a Life can show Below
What we see we know somewhat
How ruthless are the gentle --
When I hoped I feared --
Bloom upon the Mountain -- stated --
My friend attacks my friend!
Why should we hurry -- why indeed
To disappear enhances --
Where I have lost, I softer tread --
Advance is Life's condition
Like Time's insidious wrinkle
Cocoon above! Cocoon below!
The Riddle we can guess
Shame is the shawl of Pink
No Passenger was known to flee --
Pigmy seraphs -- gone astray --
The Popular Heart is a Cannon first --
The Clover's simple Fame
To the stanch Dust
Crisis is sweet and yet the Heart [stanza one]
Again -- his voice is at the door --
A little Dog that wags his tail
The pungent atom in the Air
We shun because we prize her Face
To be alive -- is Power --
Down Time's quaint stream
Now I knew I lost her --
Surgeons must be very careful
"Red Sea," indeed! Talk not to me
Good night, because we must,
So large my Will
We Cover Thee -- Sweet Face --
That Such have died enable Us
As far from pity, as complaint --
Your Riches -- taught me -- Poverty.
The Leaves like Women, interchange
Endow the Living -- with the Tears --
Split the Lark -- and you'll find the Music --
I stepped from Plank to Plank
We miss Her, not because We see --
She's happy, with a new Content --
The difference between Despair
The good Will of a Flower
It sifts from Leaden Sieves --
Of Course -- I prayed --
Truth -- is as old as God --
This Consciousness that is aware
It struck me -- every Day --
Experiment to me
Her final Summer was it --
To wait an Hour -- is long --
Except the smaller size
If I could bribe them by a Rose
Mute thy Coronation --
Unable are the Loved to die
This heart that broke so long --
You'll know Her -- by Her Foot --
Arrows enamored of his Heart --
It makes no difference abroad --
So gay a Flower
To mend each tattered Faith
It always felt to me -- a wrong
September's Baccalaureate
The most triumphant Bird I ever knew or met
A Toad, can die of Light --
Pursuing you in your transitions,
A Wind that rose
Who abdicated Ambush
To try to speak, and miss the way
Who were "the Father and the Son"
The going from a world we know
This is the place they hoped before,
Inconceivably solemn!
When I was small, a Woman died --
Is Heaven a Physician?
A chilly Peace infests the Grass
It stole along so stealthy
A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork
I asked no other thing --
I think the longest Hour of all
She bore it till the simple veins
She died -- this was the way she died.
So set it's Sun in Thee
The Truth -- is stirless --
I cautious, scanned my little life --
Fame's Boys and Girls, who never die
Title divine -- is mine!
A Drop fell on the Apple Tree --
Not what We did, shall be the test
I went to thank Her --
To lose one's faith -- surpass
How well I knew Her not
Just as He spoke it from his Hands
Give little Anguish --
The Day came slow -- till Five o'clock --
They wont frown always -- some sweet Day
We see -- Comparatively --
The Dust behind I strove to join
I started Early -- Took my Dog --
A narrow Fellow in the Grass
Alone, I cannot be --
Absence disembodies -- so does Death
He strained my faith --
Fate slew Him, but He did not drop --
A Solemn thing within the Soul
The Products of my Farm are these
Our share of night to bear --
Extol thee -- could I -- Then I will
'Twas such a little -- little boat
Let my first Knowing be of thee
Eden is that old -- fashioned House
Water makes many Beds
The Sun and Fog contested
Least Bee that brew --
Embarrassment of one another
The Days that we can spare
How Human Nature dotes
My Maker -- let me be
Had I not seen the Sun
My Triumph lasted till the Drums
Soul, Wilt thou toss again?
Touch lightly Nature's sweet Guitar
Somewhere upon the general Earth
It's Hour with itself
A wild Blue sky abreast of Winds
To own a Susan of my own
The Soul that hath a Guest
An honest Tear
In snow thou comest
Too few the mornings be,
New feet within my garden go --
'Tis good -- the looking back on Grief --
Promise This -- When You be Dying --
Betrothed to Righteousness might be
The Bee is not afraid of me.
Conferring with myself
To hang our head -- ostensibly --
Said Death to Passion
It's thoughts -- and just One Heart --
My Heart upon a little Plate
The Himmaleh was known to stoop
I tend my flowers for thee --
If anybody's friend be dead
Not all die early, dying young --
The Heart asks Pleasure -- first --
It was a Grave, yet bore no Stone
Light is sufficient to itself --
'Tis Anguish grander than Delight
Had I presumed to hope --
Her -- "last Poems" --
The Soul's Superior instants
Who saw no Sunrise cannot say
What I can do -- I will --
Away from Home are some and I --
Nature and God -- I neither knew
The Angle of a Landscape --
I had the Glory -- that will do --
To help our Bleaker Parts
There is an arid Pleasure --
Who Giants know, with lesser Men
To undertake is to achieve
Bloom -- is Result -- to meet a Flower
On such a night, or such a night,
The Sun kept stooping -- stooping -- low!
It was too late for Man --
If wrecked upon the Shoal of Thought
The Child's faith is new --
These Fevered Days -- to take them to the Forest
Opinion is a flitting thing,
I gave myself to Him --
When Memory is full
Cosmopolites without a plea
So proud she was to die
The Battle fought between the Soul
Oh what a Grace is this,
Of God we ask one favor,
Afraid! Of whom am I afraid?
Upon his Saddle sprung a Bird
I Years had been from Home
Parting with Thee reluctantly,
That sacred Closet when you sweep --
Like Mighty Foot Lights -- burned the Red
I found the words to every thought
This Me -- that walks and works -- must die,
I saw that the Flake was on it
Those not live yet
The healed Heart shows it's shallow scar
A winged spark doth soar about --
The Way I read a Letter's -- this --
To know just how He suffered -- would be dear --
Dust is the only Secret --
Bless God, he went as soldiers,
Sang from the Heart, Sire,
By my Window have I for Scenery
Perception of an object costs
Let down the Bars, Oh Death --
The Birds begun at Four o'clock --
I dreaded that first Robin, so,
Before He comes we weigh flee Time!
I went to Heaven --
Death sets a Thing significant
All Circumstances are the Frame
My Season's furthest Flower --
The One who could repeat the Summer day --
I should have been too glad, I see --
That Distance was between Us
Sweet --  You forgot -- but I remembered
The Missing All, prevented Me
Me prove it now -- Whoever doubt
She sped as Petals of a Rose
Each Scar I'll keep for Him
I'm ceded -- I've stopped being Their's --
I know that He exists.
"Why do I love" You, Sir?
The Dying need but little, Dear,
Going to Him! Happy letter!
Who is the East?
The Daisy follows soft the Sun --
Beauty crowds me till I die
Her Sweet turn to leave the Homestead
Where bells no more affright the morn --
Take all away from me, but leave me Ecstasy,
A science -- so the Savans say,
Oh Shadow on the Grass,
If I could tell how glad I was
Could I but ride indefinite
Essential Oils -- are wrung --
All men for Honor hardest work
What mystery pervades a well!
Unworthy of her Breast
Like Trains of Cars on Tracks of Plush
It came at last but prompter Death
Those Cattle smaller than a Bee
The last of Summer is Delight --
Escape is such a thankful Word
"I want" -- it pleaded -- All it's life --
Softened by Time's consummate plush,
Where Thou art -- that -- is Home --
After the Sun comes out
Winter under cultivation
To venerate the simple days
As subtle as tomorrow
Could live -- did live --
The Sun kept setting -- setting -- still
There's the Battle of Burgoyne --
He is alive, this morning --
They say that "Time assuages" --
I am ashamed -- I hide --
Two Travellers perishing in Snow
Absent Place -- an April Day --
We do not play on Graves --
"Hope" is the thing with feathers --
Only a Shrine, but Mine --
Ah, Moon -- and Star!
Me, change! Me, alter!
Death is a Dialogue between
From Us She wandered now a Year,
An Everywhere of Silver
Midsummer, was it, when They died --
Time does go on --
The Sweetest Heresy recieved
Too cold is this
Did Our Best Moment last --
There comes an hour when begging stops,
I stole them from a Bee --
These -- saw Visions --
The mob within the heart
I taste a liquor never brewed --
Revolution is the Pod
Removed from Accident of Loss
Presentiment -- is that long Shadow -- on the Lawn --
I lived on Dread --
These Strangers, in a foreign World,
It would never be Common -- more -- I said --
Make me a picture of the sun --
The Pile of Years is not so high
"Go traveling with us!"
I never hear that one is dead
Upon a Lilac Sea
Adrift! A little boat adrift!
"Sic transit gloria mundi,"
Bliss is the plaything of the child --
Baffled for just a day or two --
Hope is a subtle Glutton --
The Day she goes
A Dying Tiger -- moaned for Drink --
Follow wise Orion
The harm of Years is on him --
Of Life to own --
Delight -- becomes pictorial --
Two Lengths has every Day --
The Test of Love -- is Death --
He gave away his Life --
A stagnant pleasure like a Pool
Now I lay thee down to Sleep --
The Infinite a sudden Guest
Sweet Pirate of the heart,
The Gentian weaves her fringes --
Within thy Grave!
On this wondrous sea
If those I loved were lost
Nature assigns the Sun --
Floss wont save you from an Abyss
All things swept sole away
Summer is shorter than any one --
None can experience stint
It's such a little thing to weep --
Me -- come! My dazzled face
Dew -- is the Freshet in the Grass --
Good Morning -- Midnight --
We learn in the Retreating
You constituted Time --
What is -- "Paradise" --
The joy that has no stem nor core,
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar --
The words the happy say
He fought like those Who've nought to lose --
Through the Dark Sod -- as Education --
The Wind took up the Northern Things
Answer July --
This slow Day moved along --
Our little Kinsmen -- after Rain
A nearness to Tremendousness --
Besides this May
Bound -- a trouble --
To my quick ear the Leaves -- conferred --
If I can stop one Heart from breaking
I like a look of Agony,
To die -- takes just a little while --
Patience -- has a quiet Outer --
'Tis little I -- could care for Pearls --
Except the Heaven had come so near --
My best Acquaintances are those
Trust adjusts her "Peradventure" --
I'll send the feather from my Hat!
Shells from the Coast mistaking --
We like a Hairbreadth 'scape
If she had been the Mistletoe
A face devoid of love or grace,
Delayed till she had ceased to know --
When we have ceased to care
I noticed People disappeared
It's easy to invent a Life --
Defrauded I a Butterfly --
Some say goodnight -- at night --
As Summer into Autumn slips
To his simplicity
Not any more to be lacked --
Luck is not chance --
We thirst at first -- 'tis Nature's Act --
His Heart was darker than the starless night
She rose to His Requirement -- dropt
A South Wind -- has a pathos
A curious Cloud surprised the Sky,
A Day! Help! Help! Another Day!
Unto a broken heart
If I should cease to bring a Rose
Not "Revelation" -- 'tis -- that waits,
God made no act without a cause,
A prompt -- executive Bird is the Jay --
T'is easier to pity those when dead
"Arcturus" is his other name --
Would you like summer? Taste of ours.
Like Eyes that looked on Wastes --
The power to be true to You,
Love -- is that later Thing than Death --
There is a June when Corn is cut
I am alive -- I guess --
I've known a Heaven, like a Tent --
Delight is as the flight --
Under the Light, yet under,
Wert Thou but ill -- that I might show thee
We outgrow love, like other things
Drab Habitation of Whom?
The Mountain sat upon the Plain
Not in this World to see his face --
Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple
The Frost of Death was on the Pane --
It's Coming -- the postponeless Creature --
'Tis my first night beneath the Sun
No Rack can torture me --
I fit for them --
The most important population
Savior! I've no one else to tell --
This docile one inter
He forgot -- and I -- remembered --
To Whom the Mornings stand for Nights,
Knows how to forget!
Deprived of other Banquet,
To offer brave assistance
Superiority to Fate
I'll clutch -- and clutch --
How happy is the little Stone
Of whom so dear
How soft this Prison is
Dear March -- Come in --
Glass was the Street -- in tinsel Peril
I would distil a cup,
Who has not found the Heaven -- below --
There is another sky,
The pattern of the sun
It knew no Medicine
Must be a Wo --
Blossoms will run away,
Go slow, my soul, to feed thyself
Could Hope inspect her Basis
One Anguish -- in a Crowd --
Art thou the thing I wanted?
My period had come for Prayer --
I could die -- to know --
Death's Waylaying not the sharpest
It would not know if it were spurned,
Those -- dying then,
Valentine week
But little Carmine hath her face --
The Bible is an antique Volume --
The Guest is gold and crimson --
How firm Eternity must look
Elizabeth told Essex
Let me not mar that perfect Dream
She could not live upon the Past
My country need not change her gown,
My Faith is larger than the Hills --
It dont sound so terrible -- quite -- as it did --
When they come back -- if Blossoms do --
Do People moulder equally,
Themself are all I have --
The hallowing of Pain
My Eye is fuller than my vase --
Through those old Grounds of memory,
Safe in their Alabaster Chambers --
The parasol is the umbrella's daughter,
A Diamond on the Hand
Smiling back from Coronation
A great Hope fell
A Visitor in Marl --
The duties of the Wind are few,
A Burdock -- clawed my Gown --
We grow accustomed to the Dark --
Who occupies this House?
The Soul's distinct connection
As plan for Noon and plan for Night
These tested Oui Horizon --
'Twas Crisis -- All the length had passed --
If I'm lost -- now --
When we stand on the tops of Things --
Noon -- is the Hinge of Day --
A Night -- there lay the Days between --
I heard a Fly buzz -- when I died --
Struck, was I, nor yet by Lightning --
A Tooth upon Our Peace
Low at my problem bending,
To do a magnanimous thing
We never know how high we are
Victory comes late --
Best Gains -- must have the Losses' Test --
The Life we have is very great.
By Chivalries as tiny,
Volcanoes be in Sicily
I meant to find Her when I came --
I robbed the Woods
A face devoid of love or grace,
The Spirit is the Conscious Ear.
Precious to Me -- She still shall be --
His Mansion in the Pool
You cannot take itself
An antiquated Grace
It tossed -- and tossed --
The Moon was but a Chin of Gold
Trusty as the stars
Unto the Whole -- how add?
The Mind lives on the Heart
The look of thee, what is it like
Of Paul and Silas it is said
Going to Heaven!
Each Life Converges to some Centre --
The Heaven vests for Each
The Clouds their Backs together laid
Consulting summer's clock,
There's something quieter than sleep
I sometimes drop it, for a Quick --
To their apartment deep
I often passed the village
If it had no pencil
A Wife -- at Daybreak I shall be --
Doom is the House without the Door --
Death leaves Us homesick, who behind,
I died for Beauty -- but was scarce
A Shade upon the mind there passes
"Unto Me?" I do not know you --
Color -- Caste -- Denomination --
Of Silken Speech and Specious Shoe
Forever at His side to walk --
We met as Sparks -- Diverging Flints
I can wade Grief --
Reverse cannot befall
The Snow that never drifts --
"Heaven" -- is what I cannot reach!
A Secret told --
Soft as the massacre of Suns
They dropped like Flakes --
Purple --
The Wind -- tapped like a tired Man --
I am afraid to own a Body --
More Life -- went out -- when He went
At Half past Three, a single Bird
The Whole of it came not at once --
The grave my little cottage is,
Least Rivers -- docile to some sea.
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
Exhiliration is the Breeze
The Flower must not blame the Bee --
Wonder -- is not precisely Knowing
A Dimple in the Tomb
Knock with tremor --
The Things that never can come back, are several --
It's little Ether Hood
Yesterday is History,
My first well Day -- since many ill --
It knew no lapse, nor Diminution --
I thought that nature was enough
The Clock strikes one that just struck two --
I never told the buried gold
No matter where the Saints abide,
Death is potential to that Man
I have a Bird in spring
I groped for him before I knew
"Go tell it" -- What a Message --
Frequently the woods are pink --
As imperceptibly as Grief
The morns are meeker than they were --
That I did always love
I measure every Grief I meet
To see her is a Picture --
In this short Life
The things we thought that we should do
"Heaven" has different Signs -- to me --
It came his turn to beg --
An Antiquated Tree
I send you a decrepit flower
Birthday of but a single pang
Without a smile -- Without a Throe
Tho' I get home how late -- how late --
Paradise is that old mansion
'Twas here my summer paused
Did the Harebell loose her girdle
The distance that the dead have gone
If Nature smiles -- the Mother must
The Months have ends -- the Years -- a knot --
He told a homely tale
The Loneliness One dare not sound --
The Well upon the Brook
Prayer is the little implement
Unit, like Death, for Whom?
Shall I take thee, the Poet said
There is a flower that Bees prefer --
Kill your Balm -- and it's Odors bless you --
The smouldering embers blush --
'Twas Love -- not me --
You see I cannot see -- your lifetime --
A loss of something ever felt I --
What would I give to see his face?
Robbed by Death -- but that was easy --
How fortunate the Grave --
The Poets light but Lamps --
Denial -- is the only fact
This was a Poet -- It is That
They put Us far apart --
That is solemn we have ended
We can but follow to the Sun --
I know where Wells grow -- Droughtless Wells --
Publication -- is the Auction
Whether my bark went down at sea --
To tell the Beauty would decrease
I keep my pledge.
By a departing light
As if the Sea should part
The Lightning is a yellow Fork
Our lives are Swiss --
Alone and in a Circumstance
The Hills erect their Purple Heads
Soil of Flint, if steady tilled --
The Heart is the Capital of the Mind --
A Rat surrendered here
Have any like Myself
Love's stricken "why"
Sweet Mountains -- Ye tell Me no lie --
If He were living -- dare I ask --
No Prisoner be --
I've got an arrow here.
The Rat is the concisest Tenant.
"Was not" was all the Statement.
On the World you colored
I could bring You Jewels -- had I a mind to --
The Soul unto itself
Contained in this short Life
To-day or this noon
If I should die,
Death is like the insect
Great Streets of silence led away
Once more, my now bewildered Dove
This Dust, and it's Feature --
I meant to have but modest needs --
Why make it doubt -- it hurts it so --
Those who have been in the Grave the longest --
A Cloud withdrew from the Sky
'Twas awkward, but it fitted me --
Tie the Strings to my Life, My Lord,
Pain -- expands the Time --
I've none to tell me to but Thee
I make His Crescent fill or lack --
Over the fence --
I held a Jewel in my fingers --
For Death -- or rather
Had we known the Ton she bore
There is a Languor of the Life
That odd old man is dead a year --
From Blank to Blank --
A Charm invests a face
Lad of Athens, faithful be
We miss a Kinsman more
I'm "wife" -- I've finished that --
Much Madness is divinest Sense --
Because 'twas Riches I could own,
If Blame be my side -- forfeit Me --
To lose thee -- sweeter than to gain
I should not dare to leave my friend,
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
Come slowly -- Eden!
All but Death, can be Adjusted --
Our little secrets slink away --
It did not surprise me --
Pink -- small -- and punctual --
I saw the wind within her
No Autumn's intercepting Chill
I know Suspense -- it steps so terse
I could not prove the Years had feet --
If I may have it, when it's dead,
'Tis Seasons since the Dimpled War
Until the Desert knows
There is a word
How News must feel when travelling
Image of Light, Adieu --
One Sister have I in our house,
Come show thy Durham Breast
Obtaining but our own Extent
Sleep is supposed to be
Lives he in any other world
Frigid and sweet Her parting Face --
The feet of people walking home
I prayed, at first, a little Girl,
The most pathetic thing I do
The Moon upon her fluent Route
Had we our senses
Conjecturing a Climate
How much of Source escapes with thee --
More than the Grave is closed to me --
A little Madness in the Spring
When I count the seeds
The Symptom of the Gale --
The thought beneath so slight a film --
That it will never come again
Autumn -- overlooked my Knitting --
A slash of Blue -- A sweep of Gray --
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
It was not Saint -- it was too large --
To love thee Year by Year --
It is a lonesome Glee --
Most she touched me by her muteness --
An awful Tempest mashed the air --
What Twigs We held by --
The longest day that God appoints
You'll know it -- as you know 'tis Noon --
The Merchant of the Picturesque
When Diamonds are a Legend,
Oh Sumptuous moment
Exhiliration -- is within --
It is easy to work when the soul is at play --
'Tis Sunrise -- Little Maid -- Hast Thou
I shall keep singing!
All forgot for recollecting
A Shady friend -- for Torrid days --
The Bird must sing to earn the Crumb
Of Consciousness, her awful Mate
Unfulfilled to Observation --
I live with Him -- I see His face --
How the Waters closed above Him
I felt a Cleaving in my Mind --
No Man can compass a Despair --
Heart! We will forget him!
Best Witchcraft is Geometry
Did life's penurious length
Taken from men -- this morning --
T'was comfort in her Dying Room
'Twould ease -- a Butterfly --
Were it to be the last
Nature affects to be sedate
Their Hight in Heaven comforts not --
A single Clover Plank
"Faithful to the end" Amended
Behind Me -- dips Eternity --
Is Immortality a bane
Upon Concluded Lives
