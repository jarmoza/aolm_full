One day sunset overtook them in the deeps of the wilderness, two or three or four miles from their quarters—two corrected to ‘too’ in pencil, probably not by SLC much of a return-walk for S. But there was a small log cabin there, with a sign on it, “Entertainment for Man and Beast,” so they applied for beds and food. The proprietor lived there alone, and was his own cook and chambermaid. He was a grave, robust backwoodsman, with a business aspect. He prepared supper, and put it on the table—boiled salt pork, coffee without sugar or milk, bread with the specific gravity of gold. S. fasted, of course, but T. ate for six, and enjoyed every shovelful. The beds were of the corduroy kind, ; S. got no sleep, but and the mosquitoses were thicker than dentists in Vienna; S. got no sleep, but T. slept the night through without a break and got up fresh and fine in the morning. The breakfast was a duplicate of the supper; S. could not touch it, but T. it was manna and quail to T., and he gathered it in like personified famine. To S., who was so hungry and so incompetent, this enjoyment was next to unendurable, and he tried to think of a way to damage it. He beckoned to the landlord, took him outside, and had a private talk with him: “We are going, presently. I am paying for both. What is your bill?” “Supper, lodging and breakfast, thirty-five cents apiece; but as you pay the whole and haven’t et a bite, knock of off twenty and call it half a dollar.”
