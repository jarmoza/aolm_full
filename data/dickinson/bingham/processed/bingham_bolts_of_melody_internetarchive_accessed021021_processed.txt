BOLTS OF MELODY


PART ONE


The Far Theatricals of Day 


• 1 •

THE fingers of the light 
Tapped soft upon the town 
With, “I am great and cannot wait. 
So therefore let me in." 

“You’re soon,” the town replied, 
“My faces are asleep. 
But swear, and I will let you by. 
You will not wake them up.” 

The easy guest complied, 
But once within the town, 
The transport of his countenance 
Awakened maid and man. 

The neighbor in the pool, 
Upon his hip elate, 
Made loud obeisance, and the gnat 
Held up his cup for light.


• 2 •

THE birds begun at four o'clock— 
Their period for dawn— 
A music numerous as space 
And measureless as noon. 

I could not count their force, 
Their voices did expend 
As brook by brook bestows itself 
To magnify the pond. 

Their listener was none 
Except occasional man 
In homely industry arrayed 
To overtake the morn. 

Nor was it for applause 
That I could ascertain, 
But independent ecstasy 
Of universe and men. 

By six the flood had done, 
No tumult there had been 
Of dressing or departure, 
Yet all the band was gone. 

The sun engrossed the east, 
The day controlled the world. 
The miracle that introduced 
Forgotten as fulfilled. 


• 3 •

THE pattern of the sun 
Can fit but him alone, 
For sheen must have a disk 
To be a sun. 


• 4 •

A day! Help! Help! Another day! 
Your prayers, oh, passer-by! 
From such a common ball as this 
Might date a victory! 

From marshalings as simple 
The flags of nations swang. 
Steady, my soul—what issues 
Upon thine arrow hang! 


• 5 •

When I have seen the sun emerge 
From his amazing house 
And leave a day at every door, 
A deed in every place. 

Without the incident of fame 
Or accident of noise, 
The earth has seemed to me a drum 
Pursued of little boys. 


• 6 •

How good his lava bed 
To this laborious boy 
Who must be up to call the world 
And dress the sleepy day! 


• 7 •

Who saw no sunrise cannot say 
The countenance ’twould be; 
Who guess at seeing, guess at loss 
Of the ability. 

The emigrant of light, it is 
Afflicted for the day, 
The blindness that beheld and blest 
And could not find its eye. 


• 8 •

Morning that comes but once 
Considers coming twice. 
Two dawns upon a single morn 
Make life a sudden price. 


• 9 •

The sun is one, and on the tare 
He doth as punctual call 
As on the conscientious flower. 
And estimates them all. 


• 10 •

The bird did prance, the bee did play. 
The sun ran miles away. 
So blind with joy he could not choose 
Between his holiday; 

The morn was up, the meadows out. 
The fences all but ran— 
Republic of delight, I thought, 
Where each is citizen. 

From heavy-laden lands to thee 
Were seas to cross to come, 
A Caspian were crowded— 
Too near thou art for fame. 


• 11 •

The sun and fog contested 
The government of day. 

The sun took down his yellow whip 
And drove the fog away. 


• 12 •

Light is sufficient to itself. 
If others want to see, 
It can be had on window panes 
Some hours of the day. 

But not for compensation— 
It holds as large a glow 
To squirrel in the Himmaleh 
Precisely, as to you. 


• 13 •

Noon is the hinge of day, 
Evening the folding door, 
Morning, the east compelling the sill 
Till all the world is ajar. 


• 14 •

Rests at night the sun from shining. 
Nature, 
And some men; 

Rest at noon some men, while nature 
And the sun 
Go on. 


• 15 •

A cloud withdrew from the sky. 
Superior glory be, 
But that cloud and its auxiliaries 
Are forever lost to me. 

Had I but further scanned. 
Had I secured the glow 
In an hermetic memory 
It had availed me now. 

Never to pass the angel 
With a glance and a bow 
Till I am firm in heaven 
Is my intention now. 


• 16 •

A curious cloud surprised the sky, 
'Twas like a sheet with horns; 
The sheet was blue, the antlers gray. 
It almost touched the lawns 

So low it leaned, then statelier drew. 
And trailed like robes away— 
A queen adown a satin aisle 
Had not the majesty. 


• 17 •

A south wind has a pathos 
Of individual voice. 
As one detect on landings 
An emigrant’s address, 

A hint of ports and peoples. 
And much not understood. 
The fairer for the farness 
And for the foreignhood. 


• 18 •

It was a quiet seeming day. 
There was no harm in earth or sky 
Till with the setting sun 
There strayed an accidental red, 
A strolling hue one would have said. 
To westward of the town. 

But when the earth began to jar 
And houses vanished with a roar 
And human nature hid. 
We comprehended by the awe. 
As those that dissolution saw. 
The warrant in the cloud. 


• 19 •

A wild blue sky abreast of winds 
That threatened it did run, 
And crouched behind his yellow door 
Sat the defiant sun— 

Some conflict with those upper friends 
So genial in the main 
That we deplore peculiarly 
This arrogant campaign. 


• 20 •

The lightning is a yellow fork 
From tables in the sky 
By inadvertent fingers dropped, 
The awful cutlery 

Of mansions never quite disclosed 
And never quite concealed. 
The apparatus of the dark 
To ignorance revealed. 


• 21 •

The lightning playeth all the while. 
But when he singeth, then 
Ourselves are conscious he exist, 
And we approach him stern. 

With insulators and a glove, . 
Whose short sepulchral bass 
Alarms us, though his yellow feet 
May pass and counterpass 

Upon the ropes above our head 
Continual, with the news, 
Nor we so much as check our speech 
Nor stop to cross ourselves. 


• 22 •

Like rain it sounded till it curved. 
And then I knew *twas wind; 
It walked as wet as any wave 
But swept as dry as sand. 

When it had pushed itself away 
To some remotest plain 
A coming as of hosts was heard— 
That was indeed the rain! 

It filled the wells, it pleased the pools. 
It warbled in the road, 
It pulled the spigot from the hills 
And let the floods abroad; 

It loosened acres, lifted seas, 
The sites of centers stirred, 
Then like Elijah rode away 
Upon a wheel of cloud. 


• 23 •

The wind took up the northern things 
And piled them in the south, 
Then bent the east unto the west 
And, opening his mouth. 

The four divisions of the earth 
Did make as to devour, 
While everything to corners slunk 
Behind the awful power. 

The wind unto his chambers went. 
And nature ventured out, 
Her subjects scattered into place. 
Her systems ranged about; 

Again the smoke from dwellings rose 
The day abroad was heard. 
How intimate, a tempest past, 
The transport of the bird I 


• 24 •

Their barricade against the sky 
The martial trees withdraw, 
And with a flag at every turn 
Their armies are no more. 

What russet halts in nature’s march 
They indicate or cause. 
An inference of Mexico 
Effaces the surmise. 

Recurrent to the after mind 
That massacre of air, 
The wound that was not wound nor scar. 
But holidays of war. 


• 25 •

They called me to the window, for 
'Twas sunset, someone said. 
I only saw an amber farm 
And just a single herd 

Of opal cattle feeding far 
Upon so vain a hill 
As even while I looked dissolved. 
Nor cattle were, nor soil, 

But in their stead a sea displayed. 
And ships of such a size 
As crew of mountains could afford 
And decks to seat the skies. 

This too the showman rubbed away. 
And when I looked again, 
Nor farm, nor opal herd was there. 
Nor Mediterranean. 


• 26 •


That's the Battle of Burgoyne, 
Over every day 
By the time that man and beast 
Put their work away. 

“Sunset” sounds majestic. 
But that solemn war 
Could you comprehend it 
You would chastened stare. 


• 27 •

“Red sea,” indeedl Talk not to me 
Of purple Pharaoh, 
I have a navy in the west 
Would pierce his columns through. 

Guileless, yet of such glory fine 
That all along the line, 
Js it, or is it not, marine? 
Is it, or not, divine? 

The eye inquires with a sigh 
That earth should be so big. 
What exultation in the woe. 
What wine in the fatiguel 


• 28 •

Who is the east? The yellow man 
Who may be purple if he can. 
That carries in the sun. 

Who is the west? The purple man 
Who may be yellow if he can. 
That lets him out again. 


• 29 •

Sunset that screens, reveals. 
Enhancing what we see 
By menaces of amethyst 
And moats of mystery. 


• 30 •

The lilac is an ancient shrub. 
But ancienter than that 
The firmamental lilac 
Upon the hill tonight. 

The sun subsiding on his course 
Bequeathes this final plant 
To contemplation—not to touch— 
The flower of Occident. 

Of one corolla is the west. 
The calyx is the earth, 
The capsule's burnished seeds, the stars. 
The scientist of faith 

His research has but just begun; 
Above his synthesis 
The flora unimpeachable 
To time's analysis. 

"Eye hath not seen" may possibly 
Be current with the blind, 
But let not revelation 
By theses be detained. 


• 31 •

The sun kept stooping, stooping, low. 
The hills to meet him rose. 
On his side what transaction! 
On their side what repose! 
Deeper and deeper grew the stain 
Upon the window pane, 
Thicker and thicker stood the feet 
Until the Tyrian 
Was crowded dense with armies. 
So gay, so brigadier. 
That I felt martial stirrings 
Who once the cockade wore, 
Charged from my chimney corner— 
But nobody was there! 


• 32 •

The sunset stopped on cottages 
Where sunset hence must be 
For treason not of his, but life’s. 
Gone westerly today. 

The sunset stopped on cottages 
Where morning just begun. 
What difference after all thou mak'st. 
Thou supercilious sun! 


• 33 •

Whole gulfs of red and fleets of red 
And crews of solid blood 
Did place about the west tonight 
As 'twere a signal ground, 

And they, appointed creatures 
In authorized arrays 
Due, promptly as a drama 
That bows and disappears. 


• 34 •

The color of a queen is this— 
The color of a sun 
At setting, this and amber; 
Beryl and this at noon; 

And when at night auroran widths 
Fling suddenly on men, 
Tis this and witchcraft—nature has 
An awe of iodine. 


• 35 •

Sweet mountains, ye tell me no lie. 
Never deny me, never fly. 
Those same unvarying eyes 
Turn on me, when I fail or feign 
Or take the royal names in vain. 
Their far, slow, violet gaze. 

My strong madonnas cherish still 
The wayward nun beneath the hill 
Whose service is to you, 
Her latest worship when the day 
Fades from the firmament away 
To lift her brows on you. 


• 36 •

The mountains stood in haze. 
The valleys stopped below, 
And went or waited as they liked 
The river and the sky. 

At leisure was the sun. 
His interests of fire 
A little from remark withdrawn. 
The twilight spoke the spire. 

So soft upon the scene 
The act of evening fell 
We felt how neighborly a thing 
Was the invisible. 


• 37 •

As willing lid o’er weary eye. 
The evening on the day 
Leans till of all our nature’s house 
Remains but balcony. 


• 38 •

Fairer through fading, as the day 
Into the darkness dips away. 
Half her complexion of the sun 
Hindering, haunting, perishing, 

Rallies her glow like a dying friend. 
Teasing with glittering amend. 
Only to aggravate the dark 
Through an expiring perfect look. 


• 39 •

This slow day moved along, 
I heard its axles go 
As if they could not hoist themselves 
They hated motion so. 

I told my soul to come, 
It was no use to wait, 
We went and played and came again— 
And it was out of sight. 


• 40 •

The sun and moon must make their haste 
The stars express around, 
For in the zones of paradise 
The Lord alone is burned. 

His eye it is the East and West; 
The North and South, when He 
Do concentrate His countenance, # 
Like glowworms flee away. 

Oh, poor and far, oh, hindered eye 
That hunted for the day— 
The Lord a candle entertains 
Entirely for thee! 

• 41 •

It rises, passes, on our south 
Inscribes a simple noon, 
Cajoles a moment with the spires. 
And, infinite, is gone. 


• 42 •

The red blaze is the morning, 
The violet is noon. 
The yellow, day is falling. 
And after that is none. 

But miles of sparks at evening 
Reveal the width that burned— 
The territory argent 
That never yet consumed. 


• 43 •

A winged spark doth soar about, 
I never met it near. 
For lightning it is oft mistook 
When nights are hot and sere. 

Its twinkling travels it pursues 
Above the haunts of men— 
A speck of rapture first perceived 
By feeling it is gone. 


• 44 •

I watched the moon around the house 
Until upon a pane 
She stopped—a traveler’s privilege— 
For rest, and thereupon 

I gazed, as at a stranger 
The lady in the town 
Doth think no incivility 
To lift her glass upon. 

But never stranger justified 
The curiosity 
Like mine, for not a foot nor hand 
Nor formula had she, 

But like a head a guillotine 
Slid carelessly away, 
Did independent amber 
Sustain her in the sky; 

Or like a stemless flower 
Upheld in rolling air 
By finer gravitations 
Than bind philosopher. 

No hunger had she, nor an inn 
Her toilette to suffice, 
Nor avocation, nor concern 
For little mysteries 

As harass us—like life and death 
And afterward, or nay— 
But seemed engrossed to absolute 
With shining and the sky. 

The privilege to scrutinize 
Was scarce upon my eyes. 
When with a silver practice 
She vaulted out of gaze. 

And next I met her on a cloud, 
Myself too far below 
To follow her superior road 
Or its advantage blue. 


• 45 •

The road was lit with moon and star. 
The trees were bright and still; 
Descried I in the distant light 
A traveler on a hill 

To magic perpendiculars 
Ascending, though terrene. 
Unknown his shimmering ultimate. 
But he indorsed the sheen. 


• 46 •

’Tis my first night beneath the sun 
If I should spend it here; 
Above him is too low a height 
For his barometer 

Who airs of expectation breathes 
And takes the wind at prime. 
But distance his delights confides 
To those who visit him. 

• 47 •

How mighty the wind must feel morns, 
Encamping on a thousand dawns. 
Espousing each and spurning all. 
Then soaring to his turret tall! 

How pompous the wind must feel noons. 
Stepping to incorporeal tunes, 
Correcting errors of the sky 
And skirmishing with scenery! 

How lonesome the wind must feel nights 
When people have put out the lights. 
And everything that has an inn 
Closes his shutter and goes in ! 1 
1 In a different version the order of the stanzas is reversed. 


• 48 •

A night there lay the days between. 
The day that was before 
And day that was behind were one. 
And now 'twas night was here— 

Slow night, that must be watched away 
As grains upon a shore. 
Too imperceptible to note 
Till it be night no more. 


The Round Year 


• 49 •

The snow that never drifts— 
The transient, fragrant snow 
That comes a single time a year— 
Is softly driving now; 

So thorough in the tree 
At night beneath the star 
That it was February’s self 
Experience would swear; 

Like winter as a face 
We stern and former knew 
Repaired of all but loneliness 
By nature's alibi. 

Were every storm so spice. 
The value could not be; 
We buy with contrast—pang is good 
As near as memory. 


• 50 •

The notice that is called the spring 
Is but a month from here; 
Put up, my heart, thy hoary work 
And take a rosy chair. 

Not any house the flowers keep, 
The birds enamor care, 
Our salary the longest day 
Is nothing but a bier. 


• 51 •

I suppose the time will come— 
Aid it in the coming!— 
When the bird will crowd the tree 
And the bee be booming. 

I suppose the time will come— 
Hinder it a little— 
When the corn in silk will dress 
And in chintz the apple. 

I believe the day will be 
When the jay will giggle 
At his new white house, the earth— 
That too halt a little! 


• 52 •

Spring is the period 
Express from God. 
Among the other seasons 
Himself abide, 

But during March and April 
None stir abroad 
Without a cordial interview 
With God. 


• 53 •

I cannot meet the spring unmoved, 
I feel the old desire— 
A hurry with a lingering mixed, 
A warrant to be fair, 

A competition in my sense 
With something hid in her, 
And as she vanishes, remorse 
I saw no more of her. 


• 54 •

Had we our senses—though perhaps 
'Tis well they're not at home. 
So intimate with madness 
'Tis liable with them— 

Had we the eyes within our heads— 
How well that we are blind!— 
We could not look upon the earth 
So utterly unmoved. 


• 55 •

Summer we all have seen, 
A few of us believed; 
A few, the more aspiring. 
Unquestionably loved. 

But summer does not care, 
She goes her spacious way 
As eligible as the moon 
To our extremity. 

Created to adore, 
The affluence bestowed 
Unknown as to an ecstasy 
The embryo endowed. 


• 56 •

Someone prepared this mighty show 
To which without a ticket go 
The nations and the days. 

Displayed before the simplest door 
That all may witness it and more. 
The pomp of summer days. 


• 57 •

A soft sea washed around the house, 
A sea of summer air. 
And rose and fell the magic planks 
That sailed without a care. 

For captain was the butterfly. 
For helmsman was the bee. 
And an entire universe 
For the delighted crew. 


• 58 •

These fevered days to take them to the forest. 
Where waters cool around the mosses crawl. 
And shade is all that devastates the stillness, 
Seems it sometimes this would be all. 


• 59 •

The summer that we did not prize, 
Her treasurers were so easy. 
Instructs us by departure now; 
And recognition lazy 

Bestirs itself, puts on its coat. 
And scans with fatal promptness 
For trains that moment out of sight. 
Unconscious of his smartness. 


• 60 •

There comes a warning like a spy— 
A shorter breath of day, 
A stealing that is not a stealth, 
A symptom that is not a sound. 
And summer is away. 


• 61 •

Without a smile, without a throe. 
Do summer’s soft assemblies go 
To their entrancing end. 
Unknown, for all the times we met. 
Estranged, however intimate— 
What a dissembling friend! 


• 62 •

September’s baccalaureate 
A combination is 
Of crickets, crows, and retrospects. 
And a dissembling breeze 

That hints, without assuming. 
An innuendo sere 
That makes the heart put up its fun 
And turn philosopher . 2

• 63 •

Did we abolish frost 
The summer would not cease. 
If seasons perish or prevail 
Is optional with us. 


• 64 •

The pungent atom in the air 
Admits of no debate. 
All that is named of summer days 
Relinquished our estate 

For what department of delight 
As positive are we 
As limit of dominion 
Or dams of ecstasy. 


• 65 •

The name of it is autumn. 
The hue of it is blood. 
An artery upon the hill, 
A vein along the road. 

Great globules in the alleys. 
And oh, the shower of stain 
When winds upset the basin 
And spill the scarlet rainl 

It sprinkles bonnets far below. 
It gathers ruddy pools. 
Then eddies like a rose away 
Upon vermilion wheels . 8 

8 This poem was published in The Youth’s Companion , September 8 , 189a, 
with a different last line, “And leaves me with the hills.”


• 66 •

The products of my farm are these. 
Sufficient for my own 
And here and there a benefit 
Unto a neighbor’s bin. 

With us 'tis harvest all the year, 
For when the frosts begin,
We just reverse the zodiac 
And fetch the acres in. 


• 67 •

Twice had summer her fair verdure 
Proffered to the plain; 
Twice a winter’s silver fracture 
On the rivers been; 

Two full autumns for the squirrel 
Bounteous prepared. 
Nature! Hadst thou not a berry 
For thy wandering bird? 


• 68 •

There is a June when corn is cut 
And roses in the seed, 
A summer briefer than the first 
But tenderer indeed 

As should a face, supposed the grave's. 
Emerge a single noon 
In the vermilion that it wore, 
Affect us, and return. 

Two seasons, it is said, exist: 
The summer of the just. 
And this of ours, diversified 
With prospect and with frost. 

May not our second with its first 
So infinite compare 
That we but recollect the one 
The other to adore? 


• 69 •

Summer has two beginnings. 
Beginning once in June, 
Beginning in October 
Affectingly again. 

Without perhaps the riot. 
But graphicker for grace— 
As finer is a going 
Than a remaining face— 

Departing then forever. 
Forever until May. 

Forever is deciduous 
Except to those who die. 


• 70 •

The day grew small, surrounded tight 
By early, stooping night. 
The afternoon in evening deep 
Its yellow shortness dropped, 

The winds went out their martial ways. 
The leaves obtained excuse, 
November hung his granite hat 
Upon a nail of plush. 


• 71 •

A chilly peace infests the grass. 
The sun respectful lies, 
Not any trance of industry 
These shadows scrutinize 

Whose allies go no more abroad 
For service or for glee, 
Though all mankind do anchor here 
From whatsoever sea. 


• 72 •

It sifts from leaden sieves, 
It powders all the wood, 
It fills with alabaster wool 
The wrinkles of the road. 

It scatters like the birds. 
Condenses like a flock. 
Like juggler’s figures situates 
Upon a baseless arc. 

It traverses, yet halts, 
Disperses while it stays, 
Then curls itself in Capricorn 
Denying that it was. 4 

4 Several versions of this poem in handwriting of different periods have 
the same opening stanza. One version was published in Poems , Second 
Series, 1891, p. 174. 


• 73 •

Glass was the street, in tinsel peril 
Tree and traveler stood; 
Filled was the air with merry venture, 
Hearty with boys the road; 

Shot the lithe sleds like shod vibrations 
Emphasized and gone— 
It is the past's supreme italic 
Makes the present mean. 


• 74 •

Winter is good, his hoar delights 
Italic flavor yield 
To intellects inebriate 
With summer or the world; 

Generic as a quarry. 
And hearty as a rose, 
Invited with asperity. 
But welcome when he goes. 


My Pageantry 


• 75 •


All these my banners be! 
I sow my pageantry 
In May. 
It rises train by train, 
Then sleeps in state again. 
My chancel all the plain 
Today. 


• 76 •

To lose, if one can find again. 
To miss, if one shall meet, 
The burglar cannot rob then. 
The broker cannot cheat. 

So build the hillocks gaily 
Thou little spade of mine. 
Leaving nooks for daisy 
And for columbine. 

You and I the secret 
Of the crocus know. 
Let us chant it softly, 
"There is no more snow!” 


• 77 •

To him who keeps an orchis' heart. 
The swamps are pink with June. 5 

B Emily may have thought of 75, 76, and 77 as parts of one poem, since 
she wrote them all on one page without her usual marks of separation- 


• 78 •

Bloom is result. To meet a flower 
And casually glance 
Would cause one scarcely to suspect 
The minor circumstance 

Assisting in the bright affair 
So intricately done. 
Then offered as a butterfly 
To the meridian. 

To pack the bud, oppose the worm. 
Obtain its right of dew, 
Adjust the heat, elude the wind. 
Escape the prowling bee, 

Great nature not to disappoint 
Awaiting her that day— 
To be a flower is profound 
Responsibility! 


• 79 •

Absent place, an April day. 
Daffodils a-blow; 
Homesick curiosity 
To the soul that snow- 
Drift may block within it 
Deeper than without; 
Daffodil delight but 
Whom it duplicate. 


• 80 •

Flowers —well, if anybody 
Can the ecstasy define, 
Half a transport, half a trouble. 
With which flowers humble men. 
Anybody find the fountain 
From which floods so contra flow, 
I will give him all the daisies 
Which upon the hillside blow. 

Too much pathos in their faces 
For a simple breast like mine. 
Butterflies from San Domingo 
Cruising round the purple line 
Have a system of aesthetics 
Far superior to mine. 


• 81 •

Baffled for just a day or two, 
Embarrassed, not afraid. 
Encounter in my garden 
An unexpected maid; 

She beckons and the woods start, 
She nods and all begin— 
Surely such a country 
I was never in! 


• 82 •

They ask but our delight,
The darlings of the soil,
And grant us all their countenance 
For a penurious smile. 


• 83 •

Nobody knows this little rose. 
It might a pilgrim be 
Did I not take it from the ways 
And lift it up to thee. 

Only a bee will miss it. 
Only a butterfly, 
Hastening from far journey 
On its breast to lie. 

Only a bird will wonder. 
Only a breeze will sigh— 
Ah, little rose, how easy 
For such as thee to die ! 6 


• 84 •

Garlands for queens may be. 
Laurels for rare degree 
Of soul or sword. 
Ah, but remembering me. 
Ah, but remembering thee. 
Nature in chivalry, 
Nature in charity, 
Nature in equity, 
The rose ordained.

Artists wrestled here I 
Lo, a tint cashmere! 
Lo, a rose!
Student of the year, 
For the easel here 
Say repose!

Herein a blossom lies, 
A sepulchre between, 
Cross it and overcome the bee; 
Remain—’tis but a rind. 


• 87 •

Here, where the daisies fit my head, 
’Tis easiest to lie. 
And every grass that plays outside 
Is sorry, some, for me. 

Where I am not afraid to go 
I may confide my flower; 
Who was not enemy of me 
Will gentle be to her. 

Nor separate herself and me 
By distances become— 
A single bloom we constitute. 
Departed or at home. 


• 88 •

They have a little odor that to me 
Is metre, nay, 'tis melody, 

And spiciest at fading, indicate 
A habit of a laureate . 7 


• 89 •

Nature affects to be sedate 
Upon occasion grand. 
But let our observation halt. 
Her practices extend 

To necromancy and the trades, 
Remote to understand— 
Behold our spacious citizen 
Unto a juggler turnedl 


• 90 •

To her derided home 
A weed of summer came; 
She did not know her station low 
Nor ignominy's name 

Bestowed a summer long 
Upon a fameless flower, 
Then swept as lightly from disdain 
As lady from her bower. 

7 In Ancestors 9 Brocades, p. 36, I have used “poesy,” Emily’s alternative 
reading for “melody.”

The dandelion’s shield 
Is valid as a star; 
Leontodon's escutcheon 
Sustains her anywhere . 8 


• 91 •

Of nature I shall have enough 
When I have entered these, 
Entitled to a bumblebee’s 
Familiarities. 


• 92 •

The veins of other flowers 
The scarlet flowers are 
Till nature leisure has for terms 
As “branch” and “jugular.” 

We pass and she abides;
We conjugate her skill 
While she creates and federates 
Without a syllable. 


• 93 •

The good will of a flower 
The man who would possess 
Must first present certificate 
Of minted holiness. 

* In an earlier copy of this poem the third stanza reads: 

Of bliss the codes are few. 
As Jesus cites of Him, 
"'Come unto me,” the moiety 
That wafts the seraphim.


• 94 •

I send you a decrepit flower 
That nature sent to me 
At parting; she was going south 
And I designed to stay. 

Her motive for the souvenir.
If sentiment for me 
Or circumstance prudential. 
Withheld invincibly. 


• 95 •

When I count the seeds 
That are sown beneath 
To bloom so by and by; 
When I con the people 
Lain so low 
To be received as high; 

When I believe the garden 
Mortal shall not see. 
Pick by faith its blossom 
And avoid its bee, 
I can spare this summer 
Unreluctantly. 


• 96 •

I had some things that I called mine. 
And God, that He called His, 
Till recently a rival claim 
Disturbed these amities;

The property, my garden, 
Which having sown with care. 
He claims the pretty acre 
And sends a bailiff there. 

The station of the parties 
Forbids publicity, 
But justice is sublimer 
Than arms or pedigree. 

1*11 institute an action— 
I'll vindicate the law! 
Jove, choose your counsel, 
I retain Shaw! 9 


• 97 •

The frost was never seen; 
If met, too rapid passed. 
Or in too unsubstantial team. 
The flowers notice first 

A stranger hovering round, 
A symptom of alarm 
In villages remotely set, 
But search effaces him 

Till some retrieveless night. 
Our vigilance at waste, 
The garden gets the only shot 
That never could be traced. 

Unproved is much we know, 
Unknown the worst we fear, 
Of strangers is the earth the inn. 
Of secrets is the air. 

"A man who used to dig for her—a day laborer.” M. L. T. 

To analyze perhaps 
A Philip would prefer. 
But labor vaster than myself 
I find it, to infer. 


• 98 •

The frost of death was on the pane. 
“Protect your flower,” said he. 
Like sailors fighting with a leak 
We fought mortality. 

One passive flower we held to sea, 
To mountain, to the sun, 
Yet even on his scarlet shelf 
To crawl the frost begun. 

We pried him back. Ourselves we wedged 
Himself and her between, 
But easy as a narrow snake 
He forked his way along •

Till all her helpless beauty bent. 
And then our wrath begun! 
We hunted him to his ravine, 
We chased him to his den, 

We hated death and hated life. 
And nowhere was to go. 
The sea and continent there is 
A larger, it is woe! 


• 99 •

Like time's appointed wrinkle 
On a beloved face 
We clutch the grace the tighter 
Though we resent the crease. 

The frost, himself so comely, 
Dishevels every prime, 
Asserting from his prism 
That none can punish him. 


• 100 •

The worthlessness of earthly things 
The ditty is that nature sings 
And then enforces their delight 
Till rectitude is suffocate. 


Our Little Kinsmen 


• 101 •


Our little kinsmen after rain 
In plenty may be seen, 
A pink and pulpy multitude 
The tepid ground upon; 

A needless life it seemed to me 
Until a little bird 
As to a hospitality 
Advanced and breakfasted. 

As I of he, so God of me, 
I pondered, may have judged, 
And left the little angleworm 
With modesties enlarged. 


• 102 •

His mansion in the pool 
The frog forsakes. 
He rises on a log 
And statements makes. 

His auditors two worlds 
Deducting me, 
The orator of April 
Is hoarse today. 

His mittens at his feet 
No hand hath he. 
His eloquence a bubble 
As fame should be. 

Applaud him, to discover 
To your chagrin 
Demosthenes has vanished 
In forums green. 


• 103 •

It is a lonesome glee. 
Yet sanctifies the mind 
With fair association. 
Remote upon the wind 

A bird to overhear, 
Delight without a cause. 
Arrestless as invisible, 
A matter of the skies. 


• 104 •

These strangers in a fdireign world 
Protection asked of me; 
Befriend them, lest yourself in heaven 
Be found a refugee. 


• 105 •

Cosmopolites without a plea 
Alight in every land— 
The compliments of paradise 
From those within my hand— 

Their dappled journey to themselves 
A compensation gay. 
“Knock and it shall be opened” 
Is their theology. 


• 106 •

Touch lightly nature’s sweet guitar 
Unless thou know’st the tune, 
Or every bird will point at thee 
That wert a bard too soon. 


• 107 •

One joy of so much anguish 
Sweet nature has for me, 
I shun it as I do despair 
Or dear iniquity. 

Why birds, a summer morning 
Before the quick of day. 
Should stab my ravished spirit 
With dirks of melody. 

Is part of an inquiry 
That will receive reply 
When flesh and spirit sunder 
In death’s immediately! 


• 108 •

After all birds have been investigated and laid aside. 
Nature imparts the little bluebird, assured 
Her conscientious voice will soar unmoved 
Above ostensible vicissitude. 

First at the March, competing with the wind. 
Her gallant note exalts us like a friend, 
Last to adhere when summer swerves away. 
Fortitude stanched with melody. 10 

10 A version of this poem was printed in The New England Quarterly , April, 
193a. One variant of the last two lines had previously appeared in Letters , 
1894, p. 22a. 


• 109 •


No bobolink reverse his singing 
When the only tree 
Ever he minded occupying 
By the farmer be. 

Close to the core his spacious future, 
Best horizon gone. 
Brave bobolink, whose music be 
His only anodynel 


• 110 •

The way to know the bobolink 
From every other bird 
Precisely as the joy of him 
Obliged to be inferred: 

Of impudent habiliment 
Attired to defy, 
Impertinence subordinate 
At times to majesty; 

Of sentiments seditious. 
Amenable to law 
As heresies of transport 
Or Puck’s apostasy; 

Extrinsic to attention, 
Too intimate with joy, 
He compliments existence 
Until allured away 

By seasons, or his children 
Adult and urgent grown, 
Or unforeseen aggrandizement. 
Or possibly renown, 

By contrast certifying 
The bird of birds is gone— 
How nullified the meadow. 
Her sorcerer withdrawn! 


• 111 •

The bobolink is gone. 
The rowdy of the meadow, 
And no one swaggers now but me; 
The Presbyterian birds 
Can now resume the meeting 
He gaily interrupted 
That overflowing day 
When, opening the Sabbath 
In their afflictive way, 
He swung upon the decalogue 
And shouted, “Let us pray!" 


• 112 •

I was a phebe, nothing more, 
A phebe, nothing less; 
The little note that others dropped 
I fitted into place. 

I dwelt too low that any seek. 
Too shy that any blame; 
A phebe makes a little print 
Upon the floors of fame. 


• 113 •

A sparrow took a slice of twig 
And thought it very nice, 
I think, because his empty plate 
Was handed nature twice. 

Invigorated fully. 
Turned easy in the sky 
As a familiar saddle 
And rode immensity. 


• 114 •

The robin is a troubadour 
In humble circumstances— 
The guests of perspicacity 
A fugitive renown. 


• 115 •

You’ll know her by her foot. 
The smallest gamboge hand 
With fingers where the toes should be 
Would more affront the sand 

Than this quaint creature’s boot. 
Adjusted by a stem 
Without a button, I could vouch. 
Unto a velvet limb. 

You’ll know her by her vest. 
Tight-fitting, orange-brown. 
Inside a jacket duller 
She wore when she was born.  

Her cap is small and snug, 
Constructed for the winds; 
She’d pass for barehead short way off. 
But as she closer stands 

So finer 'tis than wool 
You cannot feel the seam. 
Nor is it clasped unto of band. 
Nor has it any brim. 

You'll know her by her voice. 
At first a doubtful tone, 
A sweet endeavor, but as March 
To April hurries on. 

She squanders on your ear 
Such arguments of pearl, 
You beg the robin in your brain 
To keep the other still. 


• 116 •

The robin for the crumb 
Returns no syllable. 
But long records the lady’s name 
In silver chronicle. 


• 117 •

She sights a bird, she chuckles, 
She flattens, then she crawls. 
She runs without the look of feet. 
Her eyes increase to balls, 

Her jaws stir, twitching, hungry. 
Her teeth can hardly stand. 
She leaps—but robin leaped the first! 
Ah, pussy of the sand. 

The hopes so juicy ripening 
You almost bathed your tongue 
When bliss disclosed a hundred wings 
And fled with every one! 


• 118 •

His bill is locked, his eye estranged. 
His feathers wilted low, 
The claws that clung, like lifeless gloves 
Indifferent hanging now; 

The joy that in his happy throat 
Was waiting to be poured, 
Gored through and through with death. To be 
Assassin of a bird * 

Resembles to my outraged mind 
The firing in heaven 
On angels, squandering for you 
Their miracles of tune. 


• 119 •

A rat surrendered here 
A brief career of cheer 
And fraud and fear. 

Of ignominy’s due 
Let all addicted to 
Beware. 

The most obliging trap 
Its tendency to snap 
Cannot resist. 

Temptation is the friend 
Repugnantly resigned 
At last. 


• 120 •

The most important population 
Unnoticed dwell; 
They have a heaven each minute. 
Not any hell; 

Their names, unless you know them, 
’Twere useless tell; 
Of bumblebees and other nations 
The grass is full. 


• 121 •

Bee, I'm expecting you I 
Was saying yesterday 
To somebody you know 
That you were due. 

The frogs got home last week. 
Are settled and at work, 
Birds mostly back. 
The clover warm and thick. 

You’ll get my letter by 
The seventeenth; reply, 
Or better, be with me. 
Yours, 
Fly. 


• 122 •

Bees are black with gilt surcingles. 
Buccaneers of buzz, 
Ride abroad in ostentation 
And subsist on fuzz. 

Fuzz ordained, not fuzz contingent. 
Marrows of the hill, 
Jugs a universe's fracture 
Could not jar or spill. 


• 123 •

The pedigree of honey 
Does not concern the bee. 
Nor lineage of ecstasy 
Delay the butterfly 

On spangled journeys to the peak 
Of some perceiveles^ thing, 
The right of way to Tripoli 
A more essential thing . 11 


• 124 •

A single clover plank 
Was all that saved a bee— 
A bee I personally knew— 
From sinking in the sky; 

’Twixt firmament above, 
And firmament below. 
The billows of circumference 
Were sweeping him away; 

11 The first two lines of this poem introduced a quatrain published 
Poems , 1890, p. 73. 

The idly swaying plank, 
Responsible to naught, 
A sudden freight of wind took on 
And bumblebee was not. 

This harrowing event 
Transpiring in the grass 
Did not so much as wring from him 
A wandering 41 Alas I” 


• 125 •

Of silken speech and specious shoe 
A traitor is the bee, 
His service to the newest grace 
Present continually; 

His suit a chance, his troth a term 
Protracted as the breeze, 
Continual ban propoundeth he. 
Continual divorce. 


• 126 •

Upon a lilac sea 
To toss incessantly 
His plush alarm, 
Who fleeing from the spring. 
The spring avenging fling 
To dooms of balm. 


• 127 •

A bee his burnished carriage 
Drove boldly to a rose, 
Combinedly alighting, 
Himself his equipage. 

The rose received his visit 
With frank tranquillity, 
Withholding not a crescent 
To his cupidity. 

Their moment consummated. 
Remained for him to flee, 
Remained for her of rapture 
But the humility. 


• 128 •

Least bee that brew a honey’s weight 
The summer multiply, 
Content her smallest fraction help 
The amber quantity. 


• 129 •

His oriental heresies 
Exhilarate the bee, 
And filling all the earth and air 
With gay apostasy. 

Fatigued at last, a clover plain 
Allures his jaded eye. 
That lowly breast where butterflies 
Have felt it meet to die. 

Intoxicated with the peace 
Surpassing revelry, 
He spends the evening of his days 
In luscious revery. 

Recounting nectars he has known 
And attars that have failed, 
And honeys, if his life be spared. 
He hungers to attain. 


• 130 •

These are the nights that beetles love! 
From eminence remote 
Drives ponderous perpendicular 
His figure intimate. 

The terror of the children. 
The jeopardy of men. 
Depositing his thunder 
He hoists abroad again. 

A bomb upon the ceiling 
Is an improving thing. 
It keeps the nerves progressive. 
Conjecture flourishing. 

Too dear the summer evening 
Without discreet alarm 
Supplied by entomology 
With its remaining charm! 

• 131 •

Two butterflies went out at noon 
And waltzed upon a farm. 
And then espied circumference 
And caught a ride with him; 

Then lost themselves and found themselves 
In eddies of the sun. 
Till rapture missed her footing 
And both were wrecked in noon. 

To all surviving butterflies 
Be this biography. 
Example, and monition 
To entomology . 12 


• 132 •

The butterfly’s Numidian gown 
With spots of burnish roasted on 
Is proof against the sun, 
Yet prone to shut its dappled fan. 
And languid on a clover lean 
As if it were undone. 


• 133 •

A moth the hue of this 
Haunts candles in Brazil. 
Nature’s experience would make 
Our reddest second pale. 
Nature is fond, I sometimes think. 
Of trinkets as a girl. 

12 A poem with the same first line was published in Poems, Second Series, 
1891, p. 153- 


• 134 •

From his slim palace in the dust 
He relegates the realm, 
More loyal for the exody 
That has befallen him. 


• 135 •

A burdock twitched my gown. 
Not burdock's blame, but mine 
Who went too near 
The burdock's den. 

A bog affronts my shoe, 
What else have bogs to do, 
The only art they know 
The splashing men? 

'Tis minnows should despise; 
An elephant's calm eyes 
Look further on. 


• 136 •

Those cattle smaller than a bee 
That herd upon the eye, 
Whose pasture is the passing crumb—: 
Those cattle are the fly. 

Of barns for winter ignorant, 
Extemporaneous stalls 
They found, to our abhorrence. 
On eligible walls, 

Reserving the presumption 
To suddenly descend 
And gallop on the furniture 
Or odiouser offend. 

Of their peculiar calling 
Unqualified to judge, 
To nature we remand them 
To justify or scourge. 


• 137 •

The judge is like the owl 
I've heard my father tell. 
And owls do build in oaks. 
So here's an amber sill 

That slanted in my path 
When going to the barn. 
And if it serve you for a house 
Itself is not in vain. 

About the price, 'tis small, 
I only ask a tune 
At midnight—let the owl select 
His favorite refrain. 


• 138 •

The spider holds a silver ball 
In unperceiv^d hands 
And dancing softly to himself 
His yarn of pearl unwinds. 

He plies from naught to naught 
In unsubstantial trade, 
Supplants our tapestries with his 
In half the period— 

An hour to rear supreme 
His theories of light, 
Then dangle from the housewife's broom. 
His sophistries forgot. 


• 139 •

The earth has many keys. 
Where melody is not 
Is the unknown peninsula. 
Beauty is nature's fact. 

But witness for her land. 
And witness for her sea. 
The cricket is her utmost 
Of elegy to me- 


• 140 •

Its little ether hood 
Doth sit upon its head— 
The millinery supple 
Of the sagacious God— 

Till when it slip away 
A nothing at a time. 
And dandelion's drama 
Expires in a stem. 


• 141 •

The jay his castanet has struck. 
Put on your muff for winter. 
The tippet that ignores his voice 
Is infidel to nature. 

Of swarthy days he is the close. 
His lotus is a chestnut, 
The cricket is a sable line— 
No more from yours at present. 


• 142 •

Four trees upon a solitary acre 
Without design 
Or order or apparent action 
Maintain. 

The sun upon a morning meets them. 
The wind; 
No nearer neighbor have they 
But God. 

The acre gives them place, 
They, him, attention of passer-by— 
Of shadow, or of squirrel, haply, 
Or boy. 

What deed is theirs unto the general nature. 
What plan 
They severally promote or hinder. 
Unknown. 


• 143 •

An antiquated tree 
Is cherished by the crow 
Because that junior foliage 
Is disrespectful now 

To venerable birds 
Whose corporation coat 
Would decorate oblivion’s 
Most pompous consulate. 


• 144 •

How fits his umber coat 
The tailor of the nut, 
Combined without a seam 
Like raiment of a dream? 

Who spun the auburn cloth? 
Computed how the girth? 
The chestnut ag£d grows 
In those primeval clothes. 

We know that we are wise. 
Accomplished in surprise, 
Yet by this countryman, 
This nature, how undone! 


• 145 •

A saucer holds a cup 
In sordid human life, 
But in a squirrel’s estimate 
A saucer holds a loaf. 

A table of a tree 
Demands the little king. 
And every breeze that run along 
His dining-room doth swing. 

His cutlery he keeps 
Between his russet lips, 
To see it flashing when he dines 
Do Birmingham eclipse. 


• 146 •

Convicted could we be 
Of our minutiae, 
The smallest citizen that flies 
Has more integrity. 


• 147 •

*Tis customary as we part 
A trinket to confer; 
It helps to stimulate the faith 
When lovers be afar. 

'Tis various as the various taste. 
Clematis, journeying far, 
Presents me with a single curl 
Of her electric hair. 

 
• 148 •

The gentian has a parched corolla 
Like azure dried, 
'Tis nature's buoyant juices 
Beatified, 
Without a vaunt or sheen, 
As casual as rain. 
And as benign. 

When most is past it comes. 
Nor isolate it seems. 
Its bond its friend; 
To fill its fringed career 
And aid an ag£d year 
Abundant end. 

Its lot were it forgot 
This truth declare: 
Fidelity is gain 
Creation o'er. 


• 149 •

I thought that nature was enough 
Till human nature came. 
But that the other did absorb 
As firmament a flame. 

Of human nature just aware 
There added the divine 
Brief struggle for capacity. 
The power to contain 

Is always as the contents. 
But give a giant room 
And you will lodge a giant 
And not a lesser man. 


Once a Child 


• 150 •

It troubled me as once I was. 
For I was once a child, 
Deciding how an atom fell 
And yet the heavens held. 

The heavens weighed the most by far, 
Yet blue and solid stood 
Without a bolt that I could prove; 
Would giants understand? 

Life set me larger problems, 
Some I shall keep to solve 
Till algebra is easier 
Or simpler proved above. 

Then too be comprehended 
What sorer puzzled me, 
Why heaven did not break away 
And tumble blue on me. 


• 151 •

It was given to me by the gods 
When I was a little girl. 
They give us presents most you know 
When we are new and small. 

I kept it in my hand, 
I never put it down, 
I did not dare to eat or sleep 
For fear it would be gone. 
 
I heard such words as “rich,” 
When hurrying to school, 
From lips at corners of the streets. 
And wrestled with a smile. 

Rich! Twas myself was rich! 
To take the name of gold, 
And gold to own in solid bars— 
The difference made me bold. 


• 152 •

The parasol is the umbrella’s daughter 
And associates with a fan, 
While her father abuts the tempest 
And abridges the rain. 

The former assists a siren 
In her serene display; 
But the latter, her sire, is honored 
And borrowed to this day. 


• 153 •

The angle of a landscape 
That every time I wake 
Between my curtain and the wall 
Upon an ample crack 

Like a Venetian, waiting. 
Accosts my open eye, 
Is just a bough of apples 
Held slanting in the sky, 

The pattern of a chimney. 
The forehead of a hill, 
Sometimes a vane’s forefinger— 
But that’s occasional. 

The seasons shift my picture. 
Upon my emerald bough 
I wake to find no emeralds; 
Then diamonds which the snow 

From polar caskets fetched me. 
The chimney and the hill 
And just the steeple’s finger. 
These never stir at all. 


• 154 •

What is paradise? Who live there? 
Are they farmers? Do they hoe? 
Do they know that this is Amherst, 
And that I am coming, too? 

Do they wear new shoes in Eden? 
Is it always pleasant there? 
Won't they scold us when we’re homesick. 
Or tell God how cross we are? 

You are sure there’s such a person 
As a Father in the sky, 
So if I get lost there, ever, 
Or do what the nurse calls “die," 

I shan’t walk the jasper barefoot. 
Ransomed folks won’t laugh at me? 
Maybe Eden ain’t so lonesome 
As New England used to be! 

• 155 •

We don’t cry, Tim and I, 
We are far too grand! 
But we bolt the door tight 
To prevent a friend. 

Then we hide our brave face 
Deep in our hand, 
Not to cry, Tim and I, 
We are far too grand! 

Nor to dream, he and me. 
Do we condescend. 
We just shut our brown eye 
To see to the end. 

“Tim, see cottages. 
But oh, so high!” 
Then we shake, Tim and I, 
And lest I cry 

Tim reads a little hymn. 
And we both pray. 
“Please, Sir, I and Tim 
Always lost the way!” 

We must die by and by 
Clergymen say, 
Tim shall, if I do, 
I too, if he. 

How shall we arrange it, 
Tim was so shy? 
Take us simultaneous, Lord 
1, Tim, and me!

I met a king this afternoon; 
He had not on a crown, indeed 
A little palm-leaf hat was all, 
And he was barefoot I'm afraid. 

But sure I am he ermine wore 
Beneath his faded jacket's blue. 
And sure I am the crest he bore 
Within that jacket's pocket too. 

For 'twas too stately for an earl, 
A marquis would not go so grand, 
’Twas possibly a czar petite, 
A pope, or something of that kind! 

If I must tell you, of a horse 
My freckled monarch held the rein. 
Doubtless an estimable beast 
But not at all disposed to run. 

And such a wagon! While I live 
Dare I presume to see 
Another such a vehicle 
As then transported me! 

Two other ragged princes 
His royal state partook, 
Doubtless the first excursion 
These sovereigns ever took. 

I question if the royal coach 
Round which the footmen wait 
Has the significance, on high, 
Of this barefoot estate! 124

A little dog that wags his tail 
And knows no other joy. 
Of such a little dog am I 
Reminded by a boy 

Who gambols all the living day 
Without an earthly cause. 
Because he is a little boy, 
I honestly suppose. 

The cat that in the corner dwells. 
Her martial day forgot, 
The mouse but a tradition now 
Of her desireless lot. 

Another class remind me 
Who neither please nor play. 
But not to make “a bit of noise" 
Beseech each little boy.

So I pull my stockings off. 
Wading in the water 
For the disobedience' sake; 
Boy that lived for “or'ter" 
Went to heaven perhaps at death. 
And perhaps he didn’t. 
Moses wasn't fairly used— 
Ananias wasn't.

The blackberry wears a thorn in his side. 
But no man heard him cry; 
He offers his berry just the same 
To partridge and to boy. 

He sometimes holds upon the fence. 
Or struggles to a tree, 
Or clasps a rock with both his hands. 
But not for sympathy. 

We tell a hurt to cool it; 
This mourner to the sky 
A little farther climbs instead—

Abraham to kill him 
Was distinctly told; 
Isaac was an urchin, 
Abraham was old. 

Not a hesitation, 
Abraham complied; 
Flattered by obeisance. 
Tyranny demurred. 

Isaac to his children 
Lived to tell the tale. 
Moral: with a mastiff 
Manners may prevail.

Over the fence strawberries grow; 
Over the fence I could climb 
If I tried, I know— 
Berries are nice! 

But if I stained my apron 
God would certainly scold! 
Oh, dear! I guess if He were a boy 
He'd climb, if He could!

He told a homely tale 
And spotted it with tears; 
Upon his infant face was set 
The cicatrice of years. 

All crumpled was the cheek 
No other kiss had known 
Than flake of snow divided with 
The redbreast of the barn. 

If mother in the grave. 
Or father on the sea. 
Or Father in the firmament. 
Or brethren, had he. 

If commonwealth below. 
Or commonwealth above 
Have missed a barefoot citizen. 
I've ransomed it alive!

Trudging to Eden, looking backward, 
I met somebody's little boy, 
Asked him his name, he lisped me, “Trotwood.” 
Lady, did he belong to thee? 

Would it comfort to know I met him, 
And that he didn’t look afraid? 
I couldn’t weep, for so many smiling 
New acquaintance this baby made.

Good to hide and hear ’em hunt! 
Better, to be found. 
If one care to, that is. 
The fox fits the hound. 

Good to know and not tell. 
Best to know and tell. 
Can one find the rare ear 
Not too dull. 


• 165 •

This dirty little heart 
Is freely mine— 
I won it with a bun— 
A freckled shrine. 

But eligibly fair 
To him who sees 
The visage of the soul 
And not the knees.

The hills in purple syllables 
The day's adventures tell 
To little groups of continents 
Just going home from school.

The lady feeds her little bird 
At rarer intervals; 
The little bird would not demur. 
But meekly recognize 

The gulf between the hand and her. 
And crumbless and afar 
And fainting, on her yellow knee 
Fall softly and adore. 


• 168 •

Mama never forgets her birds 
Though in another tree; 
She looks down just as often 
And just as tenderly 

As when her little mortal nest 
With cunning care she wove. 
If either of her “sparrows fall” 
She “notices” above . 18

'Tis one by one the Father counts, 
And then a tract between 
Set cipherless to teach the eye 
The value of its ten, 

Until the peevish student 
Acquire the quick of skill; 
Then numerals are dowered back. 
Adorning all the rule. 

'Tis mostly slate and pencil 
And darkness on the school 
Distracts the children’s fingers. 
Still the Eternal Rule 

Regards least cipher alike 
With leader of the band, 
And every separate urchin's sum 
Is fitted to his hand.

The beggar lad dies early. 
It’s somewhat in the cold. 
And somewhat in the trudging feet, 
And haply in the world— 

The cruel, smiling, bowing world— 
That took its cambric way, 
Nor heard the timid cry for “Bread! 
Sweet lady, charity!" 

Among redeemed children 
If trudging feet may stand. 
The barefoot time forgotten so, 
The sleet, the bitter wind, 

The childish hands that teased for pence 
Lifted adoring then 
To Him whom never ragged coat 
Did supplicate in vain. 


• 171 •

We do not play on graves 
Because there isn’t room; 
Besides, it isn't even. 
It slants, and people come 

And put a flower on it. 
And hang their faces so. 
We’re fearing that their hearts will drop 
And crush our pretty play. 

And so we move as far 
As enemies away. 
Just looking round to see how far 
It is, occasionally. 


• 172 •

Ribbons of the year. 
Multitude brocade. 
Worn to nature’s party once. 
Then as flung aside 

As a faded bead 
Or a wrinkled pearl— 
Who shall charge the vanity 
Of the Maker’s girl? 


• 173 •

Make me a picture of the sun 
So I can hang it in my room 
And make believe I’m getting warm 
When others call it “day”! 

Draw me a robin on a stem, 
So I am hearing him I’ll dream, 
And when the orchards stop their tune 
Put my pretense away. 

Say if it’s really warm at noon, 
Whether it’s buttercups that skim. 
Or butterflies that bloom. 
Then skip the frost upon the lea 
And skip the russet on the tree— 
Let’s play those never come!

Snow Flakes 14 

I counted till they danced so 
Their slippers leaped the town. 
And then I took a pencil 
To note the rebels down; 

And then they grew so jolly 
I did resign the prig, 
And ten of my once stately toes 
Are marshaled for a jig! 

14 Emily’s title. 


The Mob within ihe Heart 


• 175 •


The mob within the heart 
Police cannot suppress. 
The riot given at the first 
Is authorized as peace. 

Not certified of scene 
Or signified of sound, 
But growing like a hurricane 
In a congenial ground. 


• 176 •

’Tis true they shut me in the cold. 
But then, themselves were warm 
And could not know the feeling ’twas— 
Forget it. Lord, of them! 

Let not my witness hinder them 
In heavenly esteem. 
No paradise could be conferred 
Through their beloved blame. 

The harm they did was short, and since 
Myself who owe it do, 
Forgive them even as myself. 
Or else forgive not me! 


• 177 •

It would have starved a gnat 
To dine so small as I, 
And yet I was a living child 
With food's necessity 

Upon me like a claw. 
I could no more remove 
Than I could coax a leech away 
Or make a dragon move. 

Nor like the gnat had I 
The privilege to fly 
And seek a dinner for myself. 
How mightier he than I! 

Nor like himself the art 
Upon the window pane 
To gad my little being out 
And not begin again. 


• 178 •

I cried at pity, not at pain. 
I heard a woman say, 
“Poor child," and something in her voic< 
Convicted me of me. 

So long I fainted, to myself 
It seemed the common way, 
And health and laughter curious thing: 
To look at, like a toy— 

To sometimes hear ‘‘rich people” buy. 
And see the parcel rolled 
And carried, I supposed, to heaven 
For children made of gold— 

But not to touch or wish for 
Or think of, with a sigh. 


• 179 •

I was the slightest in the house, 
I took the smallest room, 
At night, my little lamp and book 
And one geranium, 

So stationed I could catch the mint 
That never ceased to fall. 
And just my basket, let me think. 
I'm sure that this was all. 

I never spoke unless addressed. 
And then *twas brief and low, 
I could not bear to live aloud 
The racket shamed me so. 

And if it had not been so far. 
And anyone I knew 
Were going, I had often thought 
How noteless I could die. 


• 180 •

A loss of something ever felt I. 
The first that I could recollect 
Bereft I was, of what I knew not. 
Too young that any should suspect 

A mourner lurked among the children. 
I notwithstanding stole about 
As one bemoaning a dominion. 
Itself the only prince cast out. 

Elder today, a session wiser— 
And fainter too, as wiseness is— 
I find myself still softly searching 
For my delinquent palaces, 

And a suspicion like a finger 
Touches my forehead now and then. 
That I am looking oppositely 
For the site of the kingdom of heaven. 


• 181 •

Alone and in a circumstance 
Reluctant to be told, 
A spider on my reticence 
Deliberately crawled. 

And so much more at home than I 
Immediately grew, 
I felt myself the visitor 
And hurriedly withdrew. 

Revisiting my late abode 
With articles of claim, 
I found it quietly assumed 
As a gymnasium 

Where, tax asleep and title off. 
The inmates of the air 
Perpetual presumption took 
As each were lawful heir. 

If any strike me on the street 
I can return the blow; 
If any seize my property, 
According to the law 

The statute is my learned friend; 
But what redress can be 
For an offense nor here nor there. 
So not in equity. 

That larceny of time and mind. 
The marrow of the day, 
By spider—or forbid it, Lord, 
That I should specify. 


• 182 •

I think the longest hour of all 
Is when the cars have come 
And we are waiting for the coach; 
It seems as though the time, 

Affronted that the joy was come. 
Did block the gilded hands 
And would not let the seconds by— 
But slowest instant ends. 

The pendulum begins to count 
Like little scholars, loud, 
The steps grow thicker in the hall. 
The heart begins to crowd. 

Then I, my timid service done. 
Though service *twas of love. 
Take up my little violin 
And further north remove. 


• 183 •

Myself can read the telegrams, 
A letter chief to me. 
The stocks' advance and retrograde 
And what the markets say, 

The weather, how the rains 
In counties have begun, 
’Tis news as null as nothing, 
But sweeter so than none. 


• 184 •

Up life's hill with my little bundle. 
If I prove it steep, 
If a discouragement withhold me, 
If my newest step 

Older feel than the hope that prompted. 
Spotless be from blame 
Heart that proposed, as heart that accepted. 
Homelessness for home. 


• 185 •

As the starved maelstrom laps the navies. 
As the vulture, teased, 
Forces the broods in lonely valleys. 
As the tiger, eased 

By but a crumb of blood, fasts scarlet 
Till he meet a man, 
Dainty adorned with veins and tissues. 
And partakes—his tongue, 

Cooled by the morsel for a moment. 
Grows a fiercer thing 
Till he esteem his dates and cocoa 
A nutrition mean— 

I, of a finer famine, 
Deem my supper dry 
For but a berry of Domingo 
And a torrid eye. 


• 186 •

I tried to think a lonelier thing 
Than any I had seen— 
Some polar expiation. 
An omen in the bone 

Of death’s tremendous nearness— 
I probed retrieveless things 
My duplicate to borrow. 
A haggard comfort springs 

From the belief that somewhere 
Within the clutch of thought 
There dwells one other creature 
Of Heavenly Love forgot. 

I plucked at our partition, 
As one should pry the walls 
Between himself and horror’s twin 
Within opposing cells. 

I almost strove to clasp his hand. 
Such luxury it grew 
That as myself could pity him 
Perhaps he pitied me. 


• 187 •

I made slow riches but my gain 
Was steady as the sun, 
And every night it numbered more 
Than the preceding one. 

All days I did not earn the same. 
But my perceiveless gain 
Inferred the less by growing than 
The sum that it had grown. 


• 188 •

I cannot buy it, ’tis not sold. 
There is no other in the world, 
Mine was the only one. 

I was so happy I forgot 
To shut the door and it went out 
And I am all alone. 

If I could find it anywhere 
I would not mind the journey there 
Though it took all my store. 

But just to look it in the eye, 
“Didst thou?” “Thou didst not mean,” to say. 
Then turn my face away. 


• 189 •

Oh, honey of an hour, 
I never knew thy power! 
Prohibit me 
Till my minutest dower. 
My unfrequented flower. 
Deserving be. 


• 190 •

So large my will. 
The little that I may 
Embarrasses 
Like gentle infamy. 

Affront to Him 
For Whom the whole were small. 
Affront to me 
Who know His meed of all. 

Earth at the best 
Is but a scanty toy. 
Bought, carried home 
To immortality, 

It looks so small 
We chiefly wonder then 
At our conceit 
In purchasing. 


• 191 •

If all the griefs I am to have 
Would only come today, 
I am so happy I believe 
They’d laugh and run awayl 

If all the joys I am to have 
Would only come today, 
They could not be so big as this 
That happens to me now I 


• 192 •

A drunkard cannot meet a cork 
Without a revery; 
And so, encountering a fly 
This January day, 

Jamaicas of remembrance stir 
That send me reeling in— 
The moderate drinker of delight 
Does not deserve the spring. 

Of juleps part are in the jug 
And more are in the joy; 
Your connoisseur in liquors 
Consults the bumblebee. 


• 193 •

The day she goes or day she stays 
Are equally supreme; 
Existence has a stated width, 
Departed or at home. 


• 194 •

Ourselves were wed one summer, dear. 
Your vision was in June, 
And when your little lifetime failed 
I wearied, too, of mine. 

And overtaken in the dark, 
Where you had put me down, 
By someone carrying a light, 
I, too, received the sign. 

'Tis true our futures different lay. 
Your cottage faced the sun, 
While oceans and the north did play 
On every side of mine. 

Tis true your garden led the bloom, 
For mine in frosts was sown, 
And yet, one summer we were queens. 
But you were crowned in June. 


• 195 •

So much summer me for showing 
Illegitimate— 
Would a smile’s minute bestowing 
Too importunate 

To the lady with the guinea 
Look, if she should know 
Crumb of mine a robin’s larder 
Could suffice to stow? 


. 196 •

Precious to me she still shall be, 
Though she forget the name I bear. 
The fashion of the gown I wear. 
The very color of my hair. 

So like the meadows now I dared 
To show a tress of theirs. 
If haply she might not despise 
A buttercup's array. 

I know the whole obscures the part. 
The fraction that appeased the heart 
Till numbers' empery, 
Remembered as the milliner's flower 
When summer’s everlasting dower 
Confronts the dazzled bee. 


• 197 •

I'll clutch and clutch. 
Next one might be the golden touch 
Could take it. 
Diamonds, wait! 
I'm diving, just a little late. 
But stars go slow for night. 

I’ll string you in fine necklace, 
Tiaras make of some. 
Wear you on hem. 
Loop up a countess with you. 
Make a diadem and mend my old one. 
Count, hoard, then lose, 
And doubt that you are mine, 
To have the joy of feeling it again! 

I'll show you at the court. 
Bear you for ornament 
Where women breathe, 
That every sigh may lift you 
Just as high as I! 

And when I die. 
In meek array display you, 
Still to show how rich I go, 
Lest skies impeach a wealth so wonderful 
And banish me. 


• 198 •

Like eyes that looked on wastes. 
Incredulous of aught 
But blank—and stead, wilderness 
Diversified by night— 

Just infinite of naught 
As far as it could see, 
So looked the face I looked upon. 
So looked itself on me. 

I offered it no help 
Because the cause was mine. 
The misery a compact 
As hopeless as divine. 

Neither would be absolved. 
Neither would be a queen 
Without the other—therefore 
We perish, though we reign. 


• 199 •

It did not surprise me, 
So I said, or thought, 
She will stir her pinions 
And, the nest forgot. 

Traverse broader forests. 
Build in gayer boughs, 
Breathe in ear more modern 
God's old-fashioned vows. 

This was but a birdling, 
What and if it be 
One within my bosom 
Had departed me? 

This was but a story. 
What and if indeed 
There were just such coffin 
In the heart instead? 


• 200 •

Had I known that the first was the last 
I should have kept it longer. 
Had I known that the last was the first 
I should have mixed it stronger. 

Cup, it was your fault, 
Lip was not the liar! 
No, lip, it was yours. 
Bliss was most to blame! 


• 201 •

How happy I was if I could forget 
To remember how sad I am 
Would be an easy adversity. 
But the recollecting of bloom 

Keeps making November difficult 
Till I, who was almost bold, 
Lose my way like a little child 
And perish of the cold. 


• 202 •

Now I knew I lost her— 
Not that she was gone, 
But remoteness traveled 
On her face and tongue. 

Alien, though adjoining, 
As a foreign race. 
Traversed she though pausing 
Latitudeless place. 

Elements unaltered, 
Universe the same, 
But love’s transmigration— 
Somehow this had come. 

Henceforth to remember 
Nature took the day 
I had paid so much for. 
His is penury 

Not who toils for freedom 
Or for family, 
But the restitution 
Of idolatry. 


• 203 •

That distance was between us 
That is not of mile or main; 
The will it is that situates. 
Equator never can. 


• 204 •

Whoever disenchants 
A single human soul 
By failure or irreverence 
Is guilty of the whole. 

As guileless as a bird. 
As graphic as a star, 
Till caviler insinuates 
Things are not what they are. 


• 205 •

I cannot want it more, 
I cannot want it less. 
My human nature's fullest force 
Expends itself on this. 

And yet it nothing is 
To him who easy owns, 
Is worth itself or distance 
He fathoms who obtains. 


• 206 •

A great hope fell, you heard no noise. 
The ruin was within. 
Oh, cunning wreck that told no tale 
And let no witness in! 

The mind was built for mighty freight. 
For dread occasion planned, 
How often foundering at sea, 
Ostensibly on land! 

A not admitting of the wound 
Until it grew so wide 
That all my life had entered it 
And there was room beside. 

A closing of the simple lid 
That opened to the sun 
Until the sovereign Carpenter 
Perpetual nail it down. 


• 207 •

Had I not seen the sun 
I could have borne the shade; 
But light a newer wilderness 
My wilderness has made. 


• 208 •

Finding is the first act; 
The second, loss; 
Third, expedition for 
The golden fleece; 

Fourth, no discovery; 
Fifth, no crew; 
Finally, no golden fleece— 
Jason sham too. 


• 209 •

I had the glory—that will do— 
An honor thought can turn her to 
When lesser fames invite. 
With one long “Nay,” bliss' early shape 
Deforming, dwindling, gulfing up 
Time's possibility.

Knows how to forget! 
But could it teach it? 
Easiest of arts they say 
When one learn how. 

Dull hearts have died 
In the acquisition. 
Sacrifice for science 
Is common though now. 

I went to school 
But was not wiser, 
Globe did not teach it 
Nor logarithm show. 

“How to forget I” 
Say, some philosopher! 
Ah, to be erudite 
Enough to know! 

Is it in a book? 
So, I could buy it. 
Is it like a planet? 
Telescopes would know. 

If it be invention 
It must have a patent. 
Rabbi of the Wise Book, 
Don’t you know? 


• 211 •

I could not prove the years had feet. 
Yet confident they run 
Am I from symptoms that are past 
And series that are done. 

I find my feet have further goals, 
I smile upon the aims 
That felt so ample yesterday— 
Today’s have vaster claims. 

I do not doubt the self I was 
Was competent to me; 
But something awkward in the fif 
Proves that outgrown, I see. 


• 212 •

I knew that I had gained 
And yet I knew not how; 
By diminution it was not, 
But discipline unto 

A rigor unrelieved 
Except by the content

In other continent.

Art thou the thing I wanted? 
Begone! My tooth has grown! 
Affront a minor palate 
That has not starved so long! 

I tell thee while I famished 
The mystery of food 
Increased till I abjured it. 
Subsisting since like God.

Where bells no more affright the morn. 
Where scrabble never comes. 
Where very nimble gentlemen 
Are forced to keep their rooms. 

Where tired children placid sleep 
Through centuries of noon— 
This place is bliss, this town is heaven! 
Please, Pater, pretty soon! 

Oh, could we climb where Moses stood 
And view the landscape o'er. 
Not Father's bells, nor factories. 
Could scare us any more! 

 
• 215 • 

If those I loved were lost. 
The crier's voice would tell me; 
If those I loved were found, 
The bells of Ghent would ring; 

Did those I loved repose, 
The daisy would impel me. 
Philip when bewildered 
Bore his riddle in! 


• 216 •

Shells from the coast mistaking, 
I cherished them for all. 
Happening in after ages 
To entertain a pearl, 

“Wherefore so late?" I murmured, 
“My need of thee be done." 
“Therefore," the pearl responded, 
“My period begin." 


• 217 •

Consulting summer's clock, 
But half the hours remain; 
I ascertain it with a shock, 
I shall not look again. 

The second half of joy 
Is shorter than the first. 
The truth I do not dare to know 
I muffle with a jest. 


• 218 •

The life that tied too tight escapes 
Will ever after run 
With a prudential look behind 
And specters of the rein. 

The horse that scents the living grass 
And sees the pastures smile 
Will be retaken with a shot 
If he is caught at all.

Of Paul and Silas it is said 
They were in prison laid. 
But when they went to take them out 
They were not there instead. 

Security the same insures 
To our assaulted minds. 
The staple must be optional 
That an immortal binds. 


• 220 •

"Escape” is such a thankful wordl 
I often in the night 
Consider it unto myself, 
No citadel in sight. 

"Escape”—it is the basket 
In which the heart is caught 
When down some awful battlement 
The rest of life is dropped. 

Tis not to sight the savior. 
It is to be the saved; 
And that is why I lay my head 
Upon this trusty word.

Escaping backward, to perceive 
The sea upon our place; 
Escaping forward, to confront 
His glittering embrace; 

Retreating up, a billow's height; 
Retreating blinded down, 
Our undermining feet to meet. 
Instructs to the divine. 


• 222 •

We like a hairbreadth ’scape. 
It tingles in the mind 
Far after act or accident. 
Like paragraphs of wind. 

If we had ventured less. 
The breeze were not so fine 
That reaches to our utmost hair 
Its tentacles divine.

My friend attacks my friend. 
Oh, battle picturesquel 
Then I turn soldier too. 
And he turns satirist. 

How martial is this place 1 
Had I a mighty gun

And then to glory run!

Deprived of other banquet 
I entertained myself, 
At first a scant nutrition. 
An insufficient loaf. 

But grown by slender addings 
To so esteemed a size 
'Tis sumptuous enough for me. 
And almost to suffice 

A robin’s hunger able. 
Red pilgrim, he and I 
A berry from our table 
Reserve for charity.

My best acquaintances are those 
With whom I spoke no word; 
The stars that stated come to town 
Esteemed me never rude 

Although to their celestial call 
I failed to make reply. 
My constant reverential face 
- Sufficient courtesy.

In thy long paradise of light 
No moment will there be

My wars are laid away in books. 
I have one battle more, 
A foe whom I have never seen 
But oft has scanned me o’er 

And hesitated me between 
And others at my side, 
But chose the best, neglecting me 
Till all the rest have died. 

How sweet if I am not forgot 
By chums that passed away, 
Since playmates at threescore and ten 
Are such a scarcity!

This me that walks and works must die 
Some fair or stormy day; 
Adversity if it may be. 
Or wild prosperity. 

The rumor’s gate was shut so tight 
Before my mind was born, 
Not even a prognostic’s push 
Can make a dent thereon.

I heard as if I had no ear 
Until a vital word 
Came all the way from life to me. 
And then I knew I heard. 

I saw as if my eye were on 
Another, till a thing— 
And now I know 'twas light because 
It fitted them—came in. 

I dwelt as if myself were out. 
My body but within. 
Until a might detected me 
And set my kernel in. 

And spirit turned unto the dust, 
“Old friend, thou knowest me/' 
And time went out to tell the news 
And met eternity. 15

Italic Faces

The hollows round his eager eyes 
Were pages where to read 
Pathetic histories, although

Biography to all who passed 
Of unobtrusive pain

Tell as a marksman were forgotten. 
Tell this day endures 
Ruddy as that coeval apple 
The tradition bears. 

Fresh as mankind that humble story. 
Though a statelier tale 
Grown in the repetition hoary 
Scarcely could prevail. 

Tell had a son—the ones that knew it 
Need not linger here; 
Those who do not, to human nature 
Will subscribe a tear. 

Tell would not bare his head in presence 
Of the ducal hat, 
Threatened for that with death by Gessler, 
Tyranny bethought 

Make of his only boy a target— 
That surpasses death. 
Stolid to love’s supreme entreaty. 
Not forsook of faith, 

Mercy of the Almighty begging, 
Tell his arrow sent. 
God it is said replies in person 
When the cry is meant.

Elizabeth told Essex 
That she could not forgive; 
The clemency of Deity, 
However, might survive. 

That secondary succor 
We trust that she partook 
When suing, like her Essex, 
For a reprieving look.

Wolfe demanded during dying, 
“Which controlled the day?” 
“General, the British.” “Easy,” 
Answered Wolfe, “to die.” 

Montcalm, his opposing spirit, 
Rendered with a smile; 
“Sweet,” said he, “my own surrender 
Liberty’s forestall.”

When the astronomer stops seeking 
For his Pleiad's face, 
When the lone British lady 16 
Forsakes the Arctic race, 

When to his covenant needle 
The sailor doubting turns, 
It will be amply early 
To ask what treason means.

The Malay took the pearl. 
Not I, the Earl; 
I feared the sea too much, 
Unsanctified to touch, 

Praying that I might be 
Worthy the destiny. 
The swarthy fellow swam 
And bore my jewel home— 

Home to the hut. What lot 
Had I the jewel got! 
Borne on a dusky breast! 
I had not deemed a vest 
Of amber fit! 

The Negro never knew 
I wooed it too. 
To gain or be undone 
Alike to him, one. 

16 Lady Jane, widow of Sir John Franklin, British naval hero lost in the 
Arctic in 1845, for years kept sending expeditions in search of him.

A faded boy in sallow clothes 
Who drove a lonesome cow 
To pastures of oblivion— 
A statesman’s embryo. 

The boys that whistled are extinct. 
The cows that fed and thanked. 
Remanded to a ballad’s barn 
Or clover’s retrospect. 


• 240 •

His mind like fabrics of the east 
Displayed to the despair 
Of everyone but here and there 
An humble purchaser. 

For though his price was not of gold 
More arduous there is; 
That one should comprehend the worth 
Was all the price there was. 


• 241 •

His heart was darker than the starless night. 
For that there is a morn, 
But in this black receptacle 
Can be no bode of dawn. 


• 242 •

The ditch is dear to the drunken man. 
For is it not his bed, 
His advocate, his edifice? 
How safe his fallen head 

In her disheveled sanctity! 
Above him is the sky. 
Oblivion enfolding him 
With tender infamy. 


• 243 •

He outstripped time with but a bout. 
He outstripped stars and sun. 
And then, unjaded, challenged God 
In presence of the throne, 

And He and he in mighty list 
Unto this present run.
The larger glory for the less 
A just sufficient ring. 


• 244 •

We shun because we prize her face 
Lest proofs ineffable disgrace 
Our adoration stain. 


• 245 • 

Her face was in a bed of hair 
Like flowers in a plot. 
Her hand was whiter than the sperm 
That feeds the sacred light. 

Her tongue more tender than the tune 
That totters in the leaves— 
Who hears may be incredulous. 
Who witnesses, believes. 


• 246 •

Unworthy of her breast— 
Though by that scathing test 
What soul survive? 
By her exacting light 
How counterfeit the white 
We chiefly have! 


• 247 •

The pretty rain from those sweet eaves— 
Her unintending eyes— 
Took her own heart, including ours. 
By innocent surprise; 

The wrestle in her simple throat 
To hold the feeling down 
That vanquished her, defeated feat. 
Was fervor’s sudden crown. 


• 248 •

His voice decrepit was with joy. 
Her words did totter so, 
How old the news of love must be 
To make lips elderly 
That purled a moment since with glee! 
Is it delight or woe 
Or terror that do generate 
This livid interview? 


• 249 •

Because he loves her we will pry 
And see if she is fair. 
What difference is on her face 
From features others wear. 

It will not harm her magic pace 
That we so far behind 
Her distances propitiate 
As forests touch the wind, 

Not hoping for his notice vast. 
But nearer to adore. 
’Tis glory’s overtakelessness 
That makes our running poor. 


• 250 •

Had we known the ton she bore 
We had helped the terror, 
But she straighter walked for freight. 
So be hers the error. 


• 251 •

An antiquated grace 
Becomes that cherished face 
Better than prime. 
Enjoining us to part, 

We and our pouting heart. 
Good friends with time. 


• 252 •

A little snow was here and there 
Disseminated in her hair; 
Since she and I had met and played 
Decade had gathered to decade. 

But time had added, not obtained. 
Impregnable the rose, 
For summer too inscrutable 
Too sumptuous for snows. 


The Infinite Aurora 


• 253 •

Struck was I, nor yet by lightning. 
Lightning lets away 
Power to perceive his process 
With vitality. 

Maimed was I, yet not by venture. 
Stone of stolid boy. 
Nor a sportsman's ruthless pleasure— 
Who mine enemy? 

Robbed was I, yet met no bandit, 
All my mansion torn, 
Sun withdrawn to recognition, 
Furthest shining done, 

Yet was not the foe of any— 
Not the smallest bird 
In the nearest orchard dwelling 
Be of me afraid. 

Most I love the cause that slew me; 
Often as I die 
Its beloved recognition 
Holds a sun on me. 

Best at setting, as is nature's, 
Neither witnessed rise 
Till the infinite aurora 
In the other’s eyes. 


• 254 •

I am alive, I guess, 
The branches on my hand 
Are full of morning-glory. 
And at my fingers' end 

The carmine tingles warm, 
And if I hold a glass 
Across my mouth it blurs it— 
Physician's proof of breath. 

I am alive, because 
I am not in a room— 
The parlor commonly it is— 
So visitors may come 

And lean, and view it sidewise, 
And add, “How cold it grew!" 
And “Was it conscious when it stepped 
In immortality?" 

I am alive, because 
I do not own a house 
Entitled to myself precise, 
And fitting no one else. 

And marked my girlhood's name 
So visitors may know 
Which door is mine, and not mistake 
And try another key. 

4 How good to be alive I 
How infinite to be 
Alive twofold, the birth I had. 
And this besides, in theel 


• 255 •

Always mine! No more vacation! 
Term of light this day begun! 
Failless as the fair rotation 
Of the seasons and the sun! 

Old the grace but new the subjects. 
Old indeed the east. 
Yet upon his purple program 
Every dawn is first. 


• 256 •

Spring comes on the world, 
I sight the Aprils, 
Hueless to me until thou come, 
As till the bee 
Blossoms stand negative, 
Touched to conditions by a hum. 


• 257 •

All that I do is in review 
To his enamored mind; 
I know his eye where'er I ply 
Is staring close behind. 

Not any port, not any pause 
But he doth there preside— 
What omnipresence lies in wait 
For an impending bride! 


• 258 •

I thought the train would never come. 
How slow the whistle sang! 
I don’t believe a peevish bird 
So whimpered for the spring. 

I taught my heart a hundred times 
Precisely what to say— 
Provoking lover, when you came 
Its treatise flew away! 

To hide my strategy, too late, 
To wiser grow, too soon, 
For miseries so halcyon 
The happiness atone. 


• 259 • 

Again his voice is at the door, 
I feel the old degree, 
I hear him ask the servant 
For such an one as me; 

I take a flower as I go 
My face to justify. 
He never saw me in this life, 
I might surprise his eye. 

I cross the hall with mingled steps, 
I silent pass the door, 
I look on all this world contains— 
Just his face—nothing more! 

We talk in venture and in toss, 
A kind of plummet strain, 
Each sounding shyly just how deep 
The other’s foot had been. 

% We walk. I leave my dog behind. 
A tender thoughtful moon 
Goes with us just a little way 
And then we are alone. 

Alone—if angels are alone 
First time they try the skyl 
Alone—if those veiled faces be 
We cannot count on high! 

I'd give to live that hour again 
The purple in my vein; 
But he must count the drops himself— 
My price for every stain! 


• 260 •

We learned the whole of love, 
The alphabet, the words, 
A chapter, then the mighty book— 
Then revelation closed. 

But in each other's eyes 
An ignorance beheld 
Diviner than the childhood's. 
And each to each a child 

Attempted to expound 
What neither understood. 
Alas, that wisdom is so large 
And truth so manifold! 
 

• 261 •

Sang from the heart, Sire, 
Dipped my beak in it. 
If the tune drip too much. 
Have a tint too red. 

Pardon the cochineal, 
Suffer the vermilion. 
Death is the wealth 
Of the poorest bird. 

Bear with the ballad. 
Awkward, faltering. 
Death twists the strings— 
Twasn't my blame— 

• Pause in your liturgies, 
Wait your chorals 
While I repeat 
Your hallowed name. 


• 262 •

Oh, sumptuous moment, slower go. 
That I may gloat on thee! 
'Twill never be the same to starve 
Since I abundance see. 

Which was to famish, then or now? 
The difference of day 
Ask him unto the gallows called 
With morning in the sky! 


• 263 •

He was weak and I was strong, then. 
So he let me lead him in. 
I was weak and he was strong, then, 
So I let him lead me home. 

’Twasn't far, the door was near, 
’Twasn’t dark, for he went too, 
'Twasn’t loud, for he said naught. 
That was all I cared to know. 

Day knocked, and we must part. 
Neither was strongest now. 
He strove, and I strove too. 
We didn’t do it though! 


• 264 •

Let my first knowing be of thee 
With morning’s warming light, 
And my first fearing, lest unknowns 
Engulf thee in the night! 


• 265 •

I felt my life with both my hands 
To see if it was there; 
I held my spirit to the glass 
To prove it possibler; 

I turned my being round and round 
And paused at every pound 
To ask the owner’s name for doubt 
That I should know the sound; 

I judged my features, jarred my hair, 
I pushed my dimples by 
And waited—if they twinkled back 
Conviction might, of me. 

I told myself, “Take courage, friend. 
That was a former time— 
But we might learn to like the heaven 
As well as our old homer* 


• 266 •

The drop that wrestles in the sea 
Forgets her own locality 
As I in thee. 

She knows herself an offering small, 
Yet small, she sighs, if all is all 
How larger be? 

The ocean smiles at her conceit 
But she, forgetting Amphitrite, 
Pleads “Me?** 


• 267 •

We talked with each other about each other 
Though neither of us spoke— 
We were listening to the seconds* races 
And the hoofs of the clock. 

Pausing in front of our palsied faces, 
Time compassion took; 
Arks of reprieve he offered to us, 
Ararats we took. 


• 268 •

Me, changeI Me, alter! Then I will 
When on the everlasting hill 
A smaller purple grows 
At sunset, or a lesser glow 
Flickers upon Cordillera 
At day's superior close! 


• 269 • 

* Falsehood of thee could I suppose, 
’Twould undermine the sill 
To which my faith pinned block by block 
Her cedar citadel. 


• 270 • 

A tongue to tell him I am true! 
Its fee to be of gold. 
Had nature in her monstrous house 
A single ragged child 

To earn a mine would run 
That interdicted way 
And tell him—charge thee, speak it plain!-— 
That so far truth is true? 

And answer what I do, 
Beginning with the day 
That night begun—nay, midnight ’twas— 
Since midnight happened, say. 

If once more—pardon, boy. 
The magnitude—thou may 
Enlarge my message, if too vast 
Another lad help thee. 

Thy pay in diamonds be. 
And his in solid gold. 
Say rubies if he hesitate. 
My message must be toldl 

Say last I said was this: 
That when the hills come down 
And hold no higher than the plain 
My bond have just begun; 

And when the heavens disband 
And Deity conclude. 
Then look for me—be sure you say 
Least figure on the road. 


• 271 •

My eye is fuller than my vase. 
Her cargo is of dew, 
And still my heart my eye outweighs 
East India for you! 


• 272 •

• Bind me, I still can sing. 
Banish, my mandolin 
Strikes true within. 

Slay, and my soul shall rise 
Chanting to paradise, 
Still thine. 


• 273 •

’Twas here my summer paused. 
What ripeness after then 
To other scene or other soul? 
My sentence had begun, 

To winter to remove, 
With winter to abide. 
Go manacle your icicle 
Against your tropic bridel 


• 274 •

t Because the bee may blameless hum 
For thee a bee do I become. 
List even unto me! 

Because the flowers unafraid 
May lift a look on thine, a maid 
Alway a flower would be. 

Nor robins, robins need not hide 
When thou upon their crypts intrude. 
So wings bestow on me. 

Or petals, or a dower of buzz, 
That bee to ride, or flower of furze, 
I that way worship thee. 


• 275 •

Rearrange a wife's affection? 
When they dislocate my brain, 
Amputate my freckled bosom, 
Make me bearded like a man! 

Blush, my spirit, in thy fastness. 
Blush, my unacknowledged clay. 
Seven years of troth have taught thee 
More than wifehood ever may! 

Love that never leaped its socket. 
Trust entrenched in narrow pain. 
Constancy through fire awarded. 
Anguish bare of anodyne, 

Burden borne so far triumphant 
None suspect me of the crown. 
For I wear the thorns till sunset. 
Then my diadem put on. 

Big my secret, but it's bandaged. 
It will never get away 
Till the day its weary keeper 
Leads it through the grave to thee. 


• 276 • 

• The world stands solemner to me 
Since I was wed to him; 
A modesty befits the soul 
That bears another's name; 

A doubt if it be fair indeed 
To wear that perfect pearl 
The man upon the woman binds 
To clasp her soul for all; 

A prayer that it more angel prove, 
A whiter gift within, 
To that munificence that chose 
So unadorned a queen: 

A gratitude that such be true— 
It had esteemed the dream 
Too beautiful for shape to prove 
Or posture to redeem 1 


• 277 •

I’ve none to tell me to but thee. 
So when thou failest, nobody. 
It was a little tie, 
It just held two, nor those it held. 
Since somewhere thy sweet face has spilled 
Beyond my boundary. 

If things were opposite, and me. 
And me it were that ebbed from thee 
On some unanswering shore, 
Wouldst thou seek so? Just say! 
That I the answer may pursue 
Unto the lips it eddied through. 
So—overtaking thee. 


• 278 • 

Robbed by death, but that was easy. 
To the failing eye 
I could hold the latest glowing; 
Robbed by liberty 

For her jugular defenses, 
This, too, I endured, 
Hint of glory it afforded 
For the brave beloved. 

Fraud of distance, fraud of danger. 
Fraud of death to bear. 
It is bounty, to suspense's 
Vague calamity. 

Staking our entire possession 
On a hair's result, 
Then seesawing coolly on it. 
Trying if it split. 


• 279 •

0 He found my being, set it up. 
Adjusted it to place, 
Then carved his name upon it. 
And bade it to the east 

Be faithful in his absence 
And he would come again 
With equipage of amber. 
That time, to take it home. 


• 280 •

I learned at least what home could be. 
How ignorant I had been 
Of pretty ways of covenant, 
How awkward at the hymn 

Round our new fireside, but for this. 
This pattern of the way. 
Whose memory drowns me like the dip 
Of a celestial sea.  

What mornings in our garden, guessed, 
What bees for us to hum, 
With only birds to interrupt 
The ripple of our theme. 

And task for both when play be done. 
Your problem of the brain, 
And mine some foolisher effect, 
A ruffle, or a tune. 

The afternoons together spent. 
And twilight in the lanes, 
Some ministry to poorer lives 
Seen poorest through our gains. 

And then return, and night and home, 
A new diviner care. 
Till sunrise call us back to scene 
Transmuted, vivider. 

This seems a home and home is not. 
But what that place could be 
Afflicts me as a setting sun 
Where dawn knows how to be! 


• 281 •

He was my host, he was my guest, 
I never to this day 
If I invited him could tell 
Or he invited me. 

So infinite our interview, 
So intimate indeed, 
Analysis like capsule seemed 
To keeper of the seed. 


• 282 •

Because that you are going 
And never coming back 
And I, however accurate. 
May overlook your track, 

Because that death is final, 
However first it be, 
This instant be suspended 
Above mortality. 

Significance that each has lived 
The other to detect— 
Discovery not God Himself 
Could now annihilate. 

Eternity, presumption. 
The instant I perceive 
That you, who were existence, 
Yourself forgot to live. 

The “life that is” will then have been 
A thing I never knew. 
As paradise fictitious 
Until the realm of you. 

* The “life that is to be” to me 
A residence too plain 
Unless in my Redeemer's face 
I recognize your own. 

Of immortality who doubts 
He may exchange with me, 
Curtailed by your obscuring face 
Of everything but he. 


Of heaven and hell I also yield 
The right to reprehend 
To whoso would commute this face 
For his less priceless friend. 

If “God is love” as He admits, 
We think that He must be 
Because He is a jealous God 
He tells us certainly. 

If “all is possible” with Him 
As He besides concedes. 
He will refund us finally 
Our confiscated gods. 17 

17 This poem was published in The Life and Mind of Emily Dickinson, by 
Genevieve Taggard, 1930. Three copies in Emily’s handwriting are not in all 
respects identical, but are not different enough to constitute three separate 
versions. The Taggard version was the one Emily sent to Colonel Higginson. 


• 283 •

Severer service of myself 
I hastened to demand 
To fill the awful vacuum 
Your life had left behind. 

I worried nature with my wheels 
When hers had ceased to run; 
When she had put away her work 
My own had just begun. 

I strove to weary brain and bone. 
To harass, to fatigue 
The glittering retinue of nerves. 
Vitality to clog. 

To some dull comfort those obtain 
Who put a head away 
They knew the hair to, and forget 
The color of the day. 

Affliction would not be appeased. 
The darkness braced as firm 
As all my stratagem had been 
The midnight to confirm. 

No drug for consciousness can be; 
Alternative to die 
Is nature's only pharmacy 
For being’s malady. 


• 284 •

A world made penniless by his departure 
Of minor systems begs. 
But sustenance is of the spirit. 
The stars but dregs. 


• 285 •

The most pathetic thing I do 
Is play I hear from you; 
I make believe until my heart 
Almost believes it too. 

But when I break it with the news, 
“You knew it was not true,” 
I wish I had not broken it, 
Goliah—so would you. 


• 286 •

To wait an hour is long 
If love be just beyond; 
To wait eternity is short 
If love be at the end. 


• 287 •

To be forgot by thee 
Surpasses memory 
Of other minds; 
The heart cannot forget 
Unless it contemplate 
What it declines. 

I was considered, then. 
Raised from oblivion 
A single time 
To be remembered! What? 
Worthy to be forgot 
Is my renown! 

For one must recollect 
Before it can forget. 


• 288 • 

Meeting by accident, 
We hovered by design. 
As often as a century 
An error so divine 

Is ratified by destiny; 
But destiny is old 
And economical of bliss 
As Midas is of gold. 


• 289 •

We met as sparks—diverging flints 
Sent various scattered ways; 
We parted as the central flint 
Were cloven with an adze, 

Subsisting on the light we bore 
Before we felt the dark, 
A flint unto this day perhaps 
But for that single spark. 


• 290 •

How sick to wait 
In any place but thine 
I knew last night 
When someone tried to twine. 

Thinking perhaps 
That I looked tired or alone 
Or breaking almost 
With unspoken pain. 

And I turned, ducal. 
That right was thine! 
One port suffices 
For a brig like mine. 

• Ours be the tossing, * 
Wild though the sea, 
Rather than a mooring 
Unshared by thee. 

Ours be the cargo 
Unladen here 
Rather than the Spicy Isles 
And thou not there. 
 

• 291 •

When I see not, I better see 
Through faith. My hazel eye 
Has periods of shutting, but 
No lid has memory. 

For often, all my sense obscured, 
I equally behold, 
As someone held a light unto 
The features so beloved, 

And I arise, and in my dream 
Do thee distinguished grace, 
Till jealous daylight interrupt 
And mar thy perfectness. 


• 292 •

One year ago jots what? 
God spell the word, I can't! 
Was't grace? Not that. 
Was't glory? That will do. 
Spell slower! Glory, 'twas just you! 

Such anniversary shall be 
Sometimes, not often, in eternity, 
When farther parted than the common woe. 
Look, feed upon each other's faces so 
In doubtful meal, if it be true 
Their banquet's real. 

I tasted careless then. 
I did not know the wine 
Came once a world, did you? 
Oh, had you told me so, 
This thirst would blister easier now! 

You said it hurt you most, 
Mine was an acorn’s breast 
And could not know how fondness grew 
In shaggier vest. 

Perhaps I couldn’t. 
But had you looked in, 
A giant eye to eye with you had been. 
No acorn then! 

So, twelve months ago 
We breathed, 
Then dropped the air. 
Which bore it best? 
Was this the patientest 
Because it was a child, you know. 
And could not value air? 

If to be “elder” mean most pain, 
I’m old enough today, I’m certain, then. 
As old as thee? How soon? 
One birthday more, or ten? 
Let me choose! . . . 
Ah! Sir, none! 


• 293 •

Sweet, you forgot, but I remembered 
Every time for two, 
So that the sum be never hindered 
Through decay of you. 

Say if I erred? Accuse my farthings. 
Blame the little hand 
Happy it be for you a beggar’s, 
Seeking more to spend. 

Just to be rich, to waste my guineas 
On so best a heart! 
Just to be poor, for barefoot vision 
You, sweet, shut me out! 18 

18 A slightly different version of the final stanza was sent to Samuel 
Bowles: 

Just to be rich, to waste my guinea 
On so broad a heart! 
Just to be poor, for barefoot pleasure 
You, Sir, shut me out! 


• 294 •

No matter now, sweet, 
But when I'm earl 
Won't you wish you’d spoken 
To that dull girl? 

Trivial a word just. 
Trivial a smile. 
But won't you wish you'd spared one 
When I’m earl? 

I shan't need it then. 
Crests will do; 
Eagles on my buckles, 
On my belt, too; 

Ermine my familiar gown— 
Say, sweet, then 
Won't you wish you'd smiled 
Just me upon? 


• 295 • 

He forgot and I remembered, 
*Twas an everyday affair 
Long ago as Christ and Peter 
Warmed them at the temple fire. 

“Thou wert with him?” quoth the damsel. 
“No,” said Peter, “ 'twasn't me.” 
Jesus merely looked at Peter— 
Could I do aught else to thee? 


• 296 •

What shall I do when the summer troubles? 
What, when the rose is ripe? 
What, when the eggs fly off in music 
From the maple keep? 

What shall I do when the skies a-chirrup 
Drop a tune on me? 
When the bee hangs all noon in the buttercup. 
What will become of me? 

Oh, when the squirrel fills his pockets 
And the berries stare. 
How can I bear their jocund faces 
Thou from here so far? 

’Twouldn't afflict a robin. 
All his goods have wings, 
I do not fly—so wherefore 
My perennial things? 


• 297 •

’Twas love, not me. 
Oh, punish, pray! 
The real one died for thee. 
Trust Him, not me. 

Such guilt to love the most! 
Doom it beyond the rest, 
Forgive it last, 
’Twas base as Jesus*, ’most! 

Let justice not mistake. 
We two looked so alike. 
Which was the guilty sake, 
’Twas love’s—now strike! 


• 298 •

Did we disobey him 
Just one time? 
Charged us to forget him. 
But we couldn’t learn. 

Were himself such a dunce 
What would we do? 
Love the dull lad best— 
Oh, wouldn’t you? 


• 299 • 

If blame be my side forfeit me, 
But doom me not to forfeit thee. 
To forfeit thee? The very name 
Is exile from belief and home! 


• 300 •

The court is far away. 
No umpire have I; 
My sovereign is offended. 
To gain his grace I’d diel 

I’ll seek his royal feet. 
I’ll say, “Remember, King, 
Thou shalt thyself one day, a child. 
Implore a larger thing. 

“That empire is of czars 
As small they say as I— 
Grant me that day the royalty 
To intercede for thee!” 


• 301 •

I’ve dropped my brain, my soul is numb. 
The veins that used to run 
Stop palsied, ’tis paralysis 
Done perfecter in stone. 

Vitality is carved and cool. 
My nerve in marble lies, 
A breathing woman yesterday 
Endowed with paradise. 

Not dumb, I had a sort that moved, 
A sense that smote and stirred, 
Instincts for dance, a caper part, 
An aptitude for bird. 

Who wrought Carrara in me 0 
And chiseled all my tune, 
Were it a witchcraft, were it death, 
I’ve still a chance to strain 

To being, somewhere—motion, breath— 
Though centuries beyond, 
And every limit a decade 
I’ll shiver, satisfied. 


• 302 •

I’ll tell thee all—how blank it grew, 
How midnight felt at first to me. 
How all the clocks stopped in the world. 
And sunshine pinched me, 'twas so cold. 

Then how the grief got sleepy some. 
As if my soul were deaf and dumb, 
Just making signs across to thee 
That this way thou couldst speak to me. 

I’ll tell you how I tried to keep 
A smile to show you when, this deep 
All waded, we look back for play 
At those old times in Calvary. 

♦ Forgive me, if the grave seem slow 
For eagerness to look at theel 
Forgive me, if to touch thy frost 
Outvisions paradise! 


• 303 •

Wert thou but ill that I might show thee 
How long a day I could endure 
Though thine attention stop not on me. 
Nor the least signal mine assure; 

Wert thou but stranger in ungracious country 
And mine the door 
Thou paused at for a doubtful bounty, 
Thou'd pause no more. 

Accused wert thou, and myself tribunal. 
Convicted, sentenced, ermine not to me 
Half the distinction thy reverse to follow. 
Just to partake the infamy. 

The tenant of the narrow cottage wert thou, 
Permit to be 
The housewife in thy low attendance 
Contenteth me. 

No service hast thou I would not achieve it. 
To die or live. 
The first, sweet, proved I ere I saw thee, 
♦ For life means love! 


• 304 • 

If I'm lost now, that I was found 
Shall still my transport be— 
That once on me those jasper gates 
Blazed open suddenly; 

That in my awkward gazing face 
The angels softly peered 
And touched me with their fleeces 
Almost as if they cared. 

I'm banished now—you know it! 
How foreign that can be 
You'll know, Sir, when the Savior's face 
Turns so, away from you! 


• 305 •

* Too scanty ’twas to die for you, 
The merest Greek could that; 
The living, sweet, is costlier— 
I offer even that. 

The dying is a trifle, past. 
But living—this include 
The dying multifold without 
The respite to be dead. 


• 306 •

This chasm, sweet, upon my life, 
I mention it to you; 
When sunrise through a fissure drop 
The day must follow too. 

If we demur, its gaping sides 
Disclose as 'twere a tomb 
Ourself am lying straight wherein, 
The favorite of doom. 

When it has just contained a life 
Then, darling, it will close. 
And yet, so bolder every day, 
So turbulent it grows, 

I'm tempted half to stitch it up 
With a remaining breath 
I should not miss in yielding, though 
To him it would be death. 

And so I bear it big about 
My burial before— 
A life quite ready to depart 
Can harass me no more. 


• 307 • 

• ’Twas my one glory— 
Let it be 
Remembered 
I was owned of thee. 


• 308 •

Nor mountain hinder me. 
Nor sea— 
Who’s Baltic? 
Who’s Cordillera ? 19 


• 309 •

Sift her from brow to bare foot. 
Strain, till your last surmise 
Drop like a tapestry away 
Before the lire’s eyes; 

Winnow her finest fondness. 
But hallow just the snow 
Intact in everlasting flake 
Oh, cavalier, for you! 


• 310 •

♦ The voice that stands for floods to me 
Is sterile borne to some; 
The face that makes the morning mean 
Glows impotent on them. 

What difference in substance lies, 
That what is sum to me 
By other financiers be deemed 
Exclusive povertyl 

19 Though written on the same page of manuscript, Emily drew a line 
between 307 and 308, indicating that they are separate poems.  


• 311 •

*Twould ease a butterfly. 
Elate a bee. 
Thou’rt neither. 
Neither thy capacity. 

• But blossom were I, 
I would rather be 
Thy moment 
Than a bee’s eternity. 

Content of fading 
Is enough for me, 
Fade I unto divinity. 

And dying, lifetime. 
Ample as the eye 
Her least attention raise on me. 


• 312 •

Still own thee—still thou art 
What surgeons call alive, 

Though slipping, slipping I perceive 
To thy reportless grave. 

Which question shall I clutch? 
What answer wrest from thee 
Before thou dost exude away 
In the recall-less sea? 


• 313 •

On the world you colored 
Morning painted rose. 
Idle his vermilion. 
Aimless crept the glows 

Over realms of orchards 
I the day before 
Conquered with the robin. 
Misery, how fair 

Till your wrinkled finger 
Pushed the sun away, 
Midnight’s awful pattern 
In the goods of day. 


• 314 •

My heart ran so to thee 
It would not wait for me, 
And I discouraged grew 
And drew away. 

For whatsoe’er my pace 
He first achieve thy face, 
How general a grace 
Allotted two I 

Not in malignity 
Mentioned I this to thee. 
Had he obliquity 
Soonest to share, 

But for the greed of him 
Boasting my premium, 
Basking in Bethlehem 
Ere I be there. 

• 315 •

Lives he in any other world 
My faith cannot reply; 
Before it was imperative 
All was distinct to me. 


• 316 •

Tried always and condemned by thee. 
Permit me this reprieve, 
That trying, I may earn the look 
For which I cease to live. 20 


• 317 •

It came his turn to beg. 
The begging for the life 
Is different from another alms, 
'Tis penury in chief. 

I scanned his narrow realm, 
I gave him leave to live 
Lest gratitude revive the snake. 
Though smuggled his reprieve. 


• 318 •

* The pile of years is not so high 
As when you came before, 
But it is rising every day 
From recollection's floor, 

And while by standing on my heart 
I still can reach the top. 
Efface the mountain with your face 
And catch me ere I drop! 

20 The two quatrains 315 and 316, though written on a single scrap ot 
paper, appear to be separate poems. 


• 319 •

The thrill came slowly like a boon 
For centuries delayed, 
Its fitness growing like the flood 
In sumptuous solitude. 

The desolation only missed 
While rapture changed its dress 
And stood amazed before the change 
In ravished holiness. 


• 320 •

I groped for him before I knew 
With solemn nameless need. 
All other bounty sudden chaff 
For this foreshadowed food 

Which others taste and spurn and slight. 
Though I within suppose 
That consecrated it could be 
The only food that grows. 


• 321 •

You said that I was “great" one day. 
Then “great" it be, if that please thee. 
Or “small," or any size at all— 
Nay, I'm the size suit thee. 

Tall, like the stag, would that? 
Or cower, like the wren? 
Or other heights of other ones 
I've seen? 

Tell which, it's dull to guess. 
And I must be 
Rhinoceros or mouse at once 
For thee. 

So say if Queen it be 
Or page. 
Please thee I'm that 
Or naught. 

Or other thing, 
If other thing there be. 
With just this— 
I suit thee.


• 322 •

Extol thee—could I—then I will 
By saying nothing new. 
But just the tritest truth 
That thou art heavenly. 

Perceiving thee is evidence 
That we are of the sky; 
Partaking thee, a guaranty 
Of immortality. 


• 323 •

Through what transports of patience 
I reached the stolid bliss 
To breathe my blank without thee. 
Attest me this and this. 

By that bleak exultation 
I won as near as this 
Thy privilege of dying— 
Abbreviate me this. 


• 324 • 

Mute thy coronation, 
Meek my “Vive le roi!” 
Fold a tiny courtier 
In thine ermine. Sir, 

There to rest revering 
Till, the pageant by, 
I can murmur, broken, 
“Master, it was 11 “ 


• 325 •

The smouldering embers blush. 
Oh, heart within the coal, 
Hast thou survived so many years? 
The smouldering embers smile. 

Soft stirs the news of light. 
The stolid seconds glow, 
One requisite has fire that lasts 
Prometheus never knew. 


• 326 • 

Long years apart can make no breach 
A second cannot fill; 
The absence of the witch does not 
Invalidate the spell. 

The embers of a thousand years, 
Uncovered by the hand 
That fondled them when they were fire. 
Will gleam and understand. 


• 327 •

Of whom so dear 
The name to hear 
Illumines with a glow 

As intimate. 
As fugitive. 
As sunset on the snow. 


• 328 •

• To die without the dying 
And live without the life— 
This is the hardest miracle 
Propounded to belief. 


• 329 •

To break so vast a heart 
Required a blow as vast; 
No zephyr felled this cedar straight, 
'Twas undeserved blast. 


• 330 •

It came at last, but prompter death * 
Had occupied the house, 
His pallid furniture arranged 
And his metallic peace. 

Oh, faithful frost that kept the date! 
Had love as punctual been, 
Delight had aggrandized the gate 
And blocked the coming in. 


• 331 •

* You constituted time. 
I deemed eternity 
A revelation of yourself. 
'Twas therefore Deity. 

The Absolute removed 
The relative away, 
That I unto Himself adjust 
My slow idolatry. 


• 332 •

Somewhere upon the general earth 
Itself exist today— 
The magic, passive but extant. 
That consecrated me. 

Indifferent seasons doubtless play 
Where I, for right to be, 
Would pawn each atom that I am 
But immortality. 

Reserving that but just to prove 
Another date of thee. 
Oh, God of width, do not for us 
Curtail eternity! 


• 333 • 

The face I carry with me last. 
When I go out of time, 
To take my rank by, in the west, 
That face will just be thine. 

I’ll hand it to the angel, 
“That, Sir, was my degree 
In kingdoms you have heard the raised 
Refer to possibly.” 

He’ll take it, scan it, step aside. 
Return with such a crown 
As Gabriel never capered at, 
And beg me put it on. 

And then he’ll turn me round and round 
To an admiring sky, 
As one that bore her master’s name— 
Sufficient royalty! 


• 334 •

When one has given up one’s life 
The parting with the rest 
Feels easy, as when day lets go 
Entirely the west; 

The peaks that lingered last 
Remain in her regret 
As scarcely as the iodine 
Upon the cataract. 


• 335 •

Recollect the face of me 
When in thy felicity, 
Due in paradise today, 
Guest of mine assuredly. 

Other courtesies have been. 
Other courtesy may be. 
We commend ourselves to thee. 
Paragon of chivalry. 


• 336 •

While it is alive, until death touches it. 
While it and I lap one air, 
Dwell in one blood under one sacrament. 
Show me division can split or pare! 

Love is like life, merely longer; 
Love is like death, daring the grave; 
Love is the fellow of the resurrection 
Scooping up the dust and chanting “Live!” 


• 337 •

So give me back to death, 
The death I never feared 
Except that it deprived of thee; 
And now, by life deprived. 
In my own grave I breathe 
And estimate its size— 
Its size is all that hell can guess 
And all that heaven surmise. 


The White Exploit 


• 338 •

Those who have been in the grave the longest. 
Those who begin today, 
Equally perish from our practice. 
Death is the further way. 

Foot of the bold did least attempt it, 
It is the white exploit 
Once to achieve annuls the power 
Once to communicate. 



THE FINAL INCH 


• 339 •

'Twas like a maelstrom, with a notch 
That nearer every day 
Kept narrowing its boiling wheel 
Until the agony 

Toyed coolly with the final inch 
Of your delirious hem, 
And you dropped, lost, when something broke 
And let you from a dream 

As if a goblin with a gauge 
Kept measuring the hours. 
Until you felt your second weigh 
Helpless in his paws. 

And not a sinew, stirred, could help, 
And sense was setting numb, 
When God remembered, and the fiend 
Let go then, overcome; 

As if your sentence stood pronounced, 
And you were frozen led 
From dungeon’s luxury of doubt 
To gibbets and the dead; 

And when the film had stitched your eyes, 
A creature gasped “Reprieve!” 
Which anguish was the utterest then. 
To perish, or to live? 


• 340 •

The manner of its death, 
When certain it must die, 
*Tis deemed a privilege to choose, 
'Twas Major Andres way. 

When choice of life is past, 
There yet remains a love 
Its little fate to stipulate. 
How small in those who live 

The miracle to tease 
With babble of the styles— 
How “they are dying mostly, now,” 
And customs at “St. James’!” 


• 341 •

Water makes many beds 
For those averse to sleep. 
Its awful chamber open stands. 
Its curtains blandly sweep; 

Abhorrent is the rest 
In undulating rooms 
Whose amplitude no clock invades. 
Whose morning never comes. 


• 342 •

The waters chased him as he fled. 
Not daring look behind; 
A billow whispered in his ear, 
“Come home with me, my friendl 

My parlor is of shriven glass, 
My pantry has a fish 
For every palate in the year.” 
To this revolting bliss 
The object floating at his side 
Made no distinct reply. 


• 343 •

Each second is the last, 
Perhaps, recalls the man 
Just measuring unconsciousness 
The sea and spar between. 

To fail within a chance 
How terribler a thing 
Than perish from the chance's list 
Before the perishing! 


• 344 •

How the waters closed above him 
We shall never know; 
How he stretched his anguish to us, 
That is covered too. 

Spreads the pond her base of lilies 
Bold above the boy 
Whose unclaimed hat and jacket 
Sum the history. 


• 345 •

Fortitude incarnate 
Here is laid away 
In the swift partitions 
Of the awful sea. 

Babble of the happy. 
Cavil of the bold, 
Hoary the fruition. 
But the sea is old. 

Edifice of ocean. 
Thy tumultuous rooms 
Suit me at a venture 
Better than the tombs. 


• 346 • 

He scanned it, staggered, dropped the loop 
To past or period. 
Caught helpless at a sense as if 
His mind were going blind; 

Groped up to see if God was there. 
Groped backward at himself, 
Caressed a trigger absently 
And wandered out of life. 


• 347 •

A dying tiger moaned for drink; 
I hunted all the sand, 
I caught the dripping of a rock 
And bore it in my hand; 

His mighty balls in death were thick, 
But searching I could see 
A vision on the retina 
Of water and of me. 

'Twas not my blame who sped too slow, 
'Twas not his blame who died 
While I was reaching him, but 'twas 
The fact that he was dead. 


• 348 •

In crashing timbers buried 
There breathed a man; 
Outside the spades were plying. 
The lungs within. 

Could he know they sought him! 
Could they know he breathed! 
Horrid sand partition. 
Neither could be heard. 

Never slacked the diggers, 
But when spades had done, 
Oh, recompense of anguish. 
He was dying then. 

Many things are fruitless, 
'Tis a baffling earth; 
But there is no gratitude 
Like the grace of death. 


• 349 •

The harm of years is on him. 
The infamy of time. 
Depose him like a fashion 
And give dominion room I 

Forget his morning forces, 
The glory of decay 
Is a denuded pageant 
Beside vitality. 


• 350 •

Two travelers perishing in snow. 
The forests as they froze 
Together heard them strengthening 
Each other with the news 

That heaven, if heaven, must contain 
What either left behind; 
And then the cheer too solemn grew 
For language, and the wind 

Long steps across the features took 
That love had touched that morn 
With reverential hyacinth. 
The taleless days went on 

Till mystery impatient drew, 
And those they left behind 
Led absent, were procured of heaven 
As those first furnished said. 


• 351 •

Pain has but one acquaintance 
And that is death; 
Each one unto the other 
Society enough. 

Pain is the junior party 
By just a second's right; 
Death tenderly assists him 
And then absconds from sight. 


• 352 •

’Twas crisis. All the length had passed. 
That dull benumbing time 
There is in fever or event. 
And now the chance had come. 

The instant holding in its claw 
The privilege to live. 
Or warrant to report the soul 
The other side the grave. 

The muscles grappled as with leads 
That would not let the will; 
The spirit shook the adamant 
But could not make it feel. 

The second poised—debated—shot— 
Another had begun. 
And simultaneously a soul 
Escaped the house unseen. 


• 353 •

Crisis is a hair 
Toward which forces creep. 
Past which forces retrograde. 
If it come in sleep, 

To suspend the breath 
Is the most we can, 
Ignorant is it life or death 
Nicely balancing. 

Let an instant push. 
Or an atom press. 
Or a circle hesitate 
In circumference. 

It may jolt the hand 
That adjusts the hair 
That secures eternity 
From presenting here. 


• 354 •

Said death to passion, “Give of thine 
An acre unto me.” 
Said passion, through contracting breaths, 
“A thousand times thee nay!” 

Bore death from passion all his east; 
He, sov’reign as the sun. 
Resituated in the west, 
And the debate was done. 


• 355 •

Death-warrants are supposed to be 
An enginery of equity— 
A merciful mistake. 
A pencil in an idol's hand 
A devotee has oft consigned 
To crucifix or block. 


THE SILVER RETICENCE 


• 356 • 

This that would greet an hour ago 
Is quaintest distance now. 
Had it a guest from paradise 
Nor glow would it, nor bow; 

Had it a summons from the noon 
Nor beam would it, nor warm— 
Match me the silver reticence! 
Match me the solid calm! 


• 357 •

The vastest earthly day 
Is shrunken small 
By one defaulting face 
Behind a pall. 


• 358 •

Oh, give it motion—deck it sweet 
With artery and vein! 
Upon its fastened lips lay words. 
Affiance it again 

To that pink stranger we call dust, 
Acquainted more with that 
Than with this horizontal one 
That will not lift its hat. 


• 359 •

Could live —did live. Could die —did die. 
Could smile upon the whole 
Through faith in one he met not 
To introduce his soul. 

Could go from scene familiar 
To an untraversed spot; 
Could contemplate the journey 
With unpuzzled heart. 

Such trust had one among us, 
Among us not today. 
We who saw the launching 
Never sailed the bay! 


• 360 •

Dying! To be afraid of thee 
One must to thine artillery 
Have left exposed a friend. 
Than thine old arrow is a shot 
Delivered straighter to the heart. 
The leaving love behind. 

Not for itself the dust is shy. 
But, enemy, beloved be 
Thy batteries' divorce. 
Fight sternly in a dying eye 
Two armies, love and certainty. 
And love and the reverse. 


• 361 •

Frigid and sweet her parting face. 
Frigid and fleet my feet, 
Alien and vain whatever clime. 
Acrid whatever fate; 

Given to me without the suit 
Riches and name and realm— 
Who was she, to withhold from me 
Hemisphere and home? 


• 362 •

We miss her, not because we see. 
The absence of an eye, 
Except its mind accompany. 
Impair society 

As slightly as the routes of stars. 
Ourselves asleep below; 
We know that their superior eyes 
Include us as they go. 


• 363 •

This docile one inter. 
While we who dare to live 
Arraign the sunny brevity 
That sparkles in the grave. 

Of her departing span 
No wilderness retain, 
As dauntless in the house of death 
As if it were her own 


• 364 •

So has a daisy vanished 
From the fields today. 
So tiptoed many a slipper 
To paradise away. 

Oozed so in crimson bubbles 
Day's departing tide, 
Blooming, tripping, flowing— 
Are ye then with God? 


• 365 •

Whatever it is she has tried it. 
Awful Father of love. 
Is not ours the chastising? 
Do not chastise the dovel 

Not for ourselves, petition. 
Nothing is left to pray. 
When a subject is finished 
Words are withered away. 

Only lest she be lonely 
In Thy beautiful house, 
Give her for her transgression 
License to think of us. 


• 366 • 

On that dear frame the years had worn. 
Yet precious as the house 
In which we first experienced light 
The witnessing, to us. 

Precious! It was conceiveless fair. 
As hands the grave had grimed 
Should softly place within our own. 
Denying that they died. 


REPEALED FROM OBSERVATION 


• 367 •

As sleigh bells seem in summer 
Or bees at Christmas show. 
So foreign, so fictitious. 
The individuals do 

Repealed from observation— 
A party whom we knew 
More distant in an instant 
Than dawn in Timbuctoo. 


• 368 •

Endow the living with the tears 
You squander on the dead 
And they were men and women now 
Around your fireside. 

Instead of passive creatures 
Denied the cherishing 
Till they the cherishing deny 
With death's ethereal scorn. 


• 369 •

Which misses most, the hand that tends. 
Or heart so gently borne 
*Tis twice as heavy as it was 
Because the hand is gone? 

Which blesses most, the lip that can. 
Or that that went to sleep 
With “if I could” endeavoring, 
Without the strength to shape? 


• 370 •

Death leaves us homesick who behind. 
Except that it is gone. 

Are ignorant of its concern 
As if it were not born. 

Through all its former places we 
Like individuals go 
Who something lost, the seeking for 
Is all that's left them now. 


• 371 •

Death is potential to that man 
Who dies, and to his friend; 
Beyond that, unconspicuous 
To anyone but God. 

Of these two, God remembers 
The longest, for the friend 
Is subsequent, and therefore 
Itself dissolved of God. 


• 372 •

“Was not” was all the statement. 
The unpretension stuns, 
Perhaps the comprehension; 
They wore no lexicons. 

But lest our speculation 
In inanition die, 
Because “God took him,” mention— 
That was philology . 21 

91 Genesis V:*4-

• 373 •

Two were immortal twice. 
The privilege of few. 
Eternity in time obtained. 
Reversed divinity. 

That our ignoble eyes 
The quality perceive 
Of paradise superlative 
Through their comparative. 


• 374 •

Death is the supple suitor 
That wins at last. 
It is a stealthy wooing. 
Conducted first 

By pallid innuendoes 
And dim approach. 
But brave at last with bugles 
And a bisected coach 

It bears away in triumph 
To troth unknown 
And kindred as responsive 
As porcelain. 


• 375 •

With pinions of disdain 
The soul can farther fly 
Than any feather certified 
By ornithology. 

It wafts this sordid flesh 
Beyond its slow control, 
And during its electric spell 
The body is a soul. 

Instructing by itself. 
How little work it be 
To put off filaments like this 
For immortality! 


• 376 •

It knew no lapse nor diminution, 
But large, serene, 
Glowed on until through dissolution 
It failed from men. 

I could not deem these planetary forces 
Annulled, 
But suffered an exchange of territory 
Or world. 


• 377 • 

He lived the life of ambush 
And went the way of dusk, 
And now against his subtle name 
There stands an asterisk 

As confident of him as we— 
Impregnable we are— 
The whole of immortality 
Intrenched within a sta*. 


• 378 •

Gathered into the earth 
And out of story. 
Gathered to that strange fame. 
That lonesome glory 
That hath no omen here 
But awe. 


• 379 •

'Tis not that dying hurts us so, 
'Tis living hurts us more. 
But dying is a different way, 
A kind behind the door, 

The southern custom of the birds 
That ere the frosts are due 
Accepts a better latitude. 
We are the birds that stay— 

The shiverers 'round farmers' doors. 
For whose reluctant crumb 
We stipulate, till pitying snows 
Persuade our feathers home. 


• 380 •

As plan for noon and plan for night. 
So differ life and death 
In positive prospective. 
The foot upon the earth 

At distance and achievement strains; 
The foot upon the grave 
Makes effort at conclusion. 
Assisted faint of love. 


• 381 •

The opening and the close 
Of being are alike. 
Or differ, if they do. 
As bloom upon a stalk 

That from an equal seed 
Unto an equal bud 
Go parallel, perfected 
In that they have decayed. 


• 382 •

Left in immortal youth 
On that low plain 
That hath nor peradventure 
Nor again; 

Ransomed from years, 
Sequestered from decay. 
Canceled like dawn 
In comprehensive day! 



LIDS OF STEEL 


• 383 •

Sweet safe houses—glad gay houses— 
Sealed so stately tight! 
Lids of steel on lids of marble 
Locking bare feet out. 

Brooks of plush in banks of satin 
Not so softly fall 
As the laughter and the whisper 
From their people pearl. 

No bald death affront their parlors. 
No bold sickness come 
To deface their stately treasures. 
Anguish and the tomb 

Hum by, in muffled coaches. 
Lest they wonder why 
Any, for the press of smiling. 
Interrupt to die. 


• 384 •

Back from the cordial grave I drag thee, 
He shall not take thy hand 
Nor put his spacious arm around thee— 
That none can understand. 


• 385 • 

More than the grave is closed to me— 
The grave and that eternity 
To which the grave adheres. 
I cling to nowhere till I fall. 
The crash of nothing, yet of all. 
How similar appears! 


• 386 •

A coffin is a small domain 
Yet able to contain 
A rudiment of paradise 
In its diminished plane. 

A grave is a restricted breadth 
Yet ampler than the sun 
And all the seas he populates 
And lands he looks upon. 

To him who on its low repose 
Bestows a single friend— 
Circumference without relief. 
Or estimate, or end. 


• 387 •

Lain in nature, so suffice us 
The enchantless pod 
When we advertise existence 
For the missing seed. 

Maddest heart that God created 
Cannot move a sod 
Pasted by the simple summer 
On the soldered dead. 


• 388 •

Snow beneath whose chilly softness 
Some that never lay 
Make their first repose this winter, 
I admonish thee 

Blanket wealthier the neighbor 
We so new bestow 
Than thine acclimated creature— 
Wilt thou, Russian snow? 


• 389 •

Who occupies this house? 
A stranger I must judge 
Since no one knows his circumstance. 
’Tis well the name and age 

Are writ upon the door 
Or I should fear to pause 
Where not so much as honest dog 
Approach encourages. 

It seems a curious town, 
Some houses very old, 
Some newly raised this afternoon. 
Were I compelled to build 

It should not be among 
Inhabitants so still. 
But where the birds assemble 
And boys were possible. 

Before myself was born 
’Twas settled, so they say, 
A territory for the ghosts 
And squirrels formerly. 

Until a pioneer, 
As settlers often do. 
Liking the quiet of the place 
Attracted more unto; 

And from a settlement 
A capital has grown. 
Distinguished for the gravity 
Of every citizen. 

The owner of this house 
A stranger he must be. 
Eternity's acquaintances 
Are mostly so to me. 


• 390 • 

Knock with tremor; these are Caesars. 
Should they be at home, 
Flee as if you trod unthinking 
On the foot of doom. 

These seceded from your substance 
Centuries ago; 
Should they rend you with “How are you?" 
What have you to show? 


• 391 •

How fortunate the grave. 
All prizes to obtain, 
Successful certain, if at last. 
First suitor not in vain. 

• 392 •

Do people moulder equally 
They bury in the grave? 
I do believe a species 
As positively live 

As I, who testify it, 
Deny that I am dead 
And fill my lungs for witness 
From tanks above my head. 

“I say to you,” said Jesus, 
“That there be standing here 
A sort that shall not taste of death.” 
If Jesus was sincere 

I need no further argue. 
The statement of the Lord 
Is not a controvertible. 
He told me death was dead. 


• 393 •

Under the light, yet under. 
Under the grass and the dirt. 
Under the beetle’s cellar, 
Under the clover’s foot, 

Further than arm could stretch 
Were it giant long, 
Further than sunshine could 
Were the day year long; 

Over the light, yet over. 
Over the arc of the bird. 
Over the comet’s chimney. 
Over the cubit’s head, 

Further than guess can gallop. 
Further than riddle ride— 
Oh, for a disk to the distance 
Between ourselves and the deadl 


• 394 •

There is a finished feeling 
Experienced at graves— 
A leisure of the future, 
A wilderness of size. 

By death's bold exhibition 
Preciser what we are 
And the eternal function 
Enabled to infer. 


CONCLUDED LIVES 


• 395 •

Upon concluded lives 
There's nothing cooler falls 
Than life's sweet calculations. 
The mixing bells and palls 

Makes lacerating tune 
To ears the dying side; 
'Tis coronal and funeral 
Saluting in the road. 


• 396 •


The chemical conviction 
That naught be lost 
Enable in disaster 
My fractured trust. 

The faces of the atoms 
If I shall see. 
How more the finished creatures 
Departed me! 


• 397 •

A shade upon the mind there passes. 
As when on noon 
A cloud the mighty sun encloses, 
Remembering 

That some there be too numb to notice. 
Oh, God! 
Why give if Thou must take away 
The loved? 


• 398 •

Within thy gravel Oh, no. 
But on some other flightl 
Thou only earnest to mankind 
To rend it with “Good night!” 


• 399 •

“I want,” it pleaded all its life. 
“I want” was chief it said 
When skill entreated it, the last. 
And when so newly dead 

I could not deem it late to hear 
That single, steadfast sigh 
The lips had placed, as with a “Please,” 
Toward eternity. 


• 400 •

“Good night,” because we mustl 
How intricate the dustl 
I would go to know— 
Oh, incognito! 

Saucy, saucy seraph 
To elude me so! 
Father! They won't tell me! 
Won't you tell them to? 

 
• 401 •

Whether they have forgotten, 
Or are forgetting now, 
Or never remembered, 
Safer not to know. 

Miseries of conjecture 
Are a softer woe 
Than a fact of iron 
Hardened with “I know.” 


• 402 • 

What did they do since I saw them? 
Were they industrious? 
So many questions to put them 
Have I the eagerness 

That could I snatch their faces. 
That could their lips reply. 
Not till the last was answered 
Should they start for the sky! 

Not if their party were waiting, 
Not if to talk with me 
Were to them now homesickness 
After eternity; 

Not if the just suspect me 
And offer a reward 
Would I restore my booty 
To that bold person God ! 22 

22 Written on a separate slip of paper pinned over the third stanza by 
Emily herself, the fourth stanza may have been intended as an alternative. 


• 403 •

These tested our horizon, 
Then disappeared, 
As birds before achieving 
A latitude. 

Our retrospection of them 
A fixed delight. 
But our anticipation 
A dice—a doubt. 


• 404 •

She rose as high as his occasion 
Then sought the dust. 
And lower lay in low Westminster 
For her brief crest. 


• 405 •

The road to paradise is plain 
And holds scarce one; 
Not that it has not room, 
But we presume 
A dappled road 
Is more preferred. 
The guests of paradise are few. 
Not me, nor you, 
But unsuspected things; 
Mines have no wings. 


• 406 •

That odd old man is dead a year. 
We miss his stated hat; 
'Twas such an evening bright and stiff 
His faded lamp went out. 

Who miss his antiquated wick? 
Are any hoar for him? 
Waits any indurated mate 
His wrinkled coming home? 

Oh, life, begun in fluent blood 
And consummated dull! 
Achievement contemplating this 
Feels transitive and cool. 


• 407 •

That this should feel the need of death 
The same as those that lived, 
Is such a feat of irony 
As never was achieved. 

Not satisfied to ape the great 
In his simplicity, 
The small must die the same as he— 
Oh, the audacity! 


• 408 •

Praise it—*tis dead, it cannot glow— 
Warm this inclement ear 
With the encomium it earned 
Since it was gathered here. 

Invest this alabaster zest 
In the delights of dust 
Remitted, since it flitted it. 
In recusance august. 


CREATURES CLAD IN MIRACLE 


• 409 •

’Tis anguish grander than delight, 
’Tis resurrection pain— 
The meeting bands of smitten face 
We questioned to, again. 

’Tis transport wild as thrills the graves 
When cerements let go 
And creatures clad in miracle 
Go up by two and two . 23 

• 410 •

How firm eternity must look 
To crumbling men like me. 
The only adamant estate 
In all identity! 

How mighty to the insecure 
Thy physiognomy. 
To whom not any face cohere 
Unless concealed in thee! 

28 A variant of the last three lines appeared in the quatrain, “I’m thinking 
of that other morn,” in The Single Hound, p. 96. 


• 411 •

As watchers hang upon the east. 
As beggars revel at a feast 
By savory fancy spread, 
As brooks in deserts babble sweet 
On ear too far for the delight, 
Heaven beguiles the tired. 

As that same watcher, when the east 
Opens the lid of amethyst 
And lets the morning go. 
That beggar, when an honored guest. 
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed. 
Heaven to us, if true. 


• 412 •

The fact that earth is heaven. 
Whether heaven is heaven or not. 
If not an affidavit 
Of that specific spot, 

Not only must confirm us 
That it is not for us, 
But that it would affront us 
To dwell in such a place. 


• 413 •

The hallowing of pain, 
Like hallowing of heaven. 
Obtains at a corporeal cost. 
The summit is not given 

To him who strives severe 
At bottom of the hill, 
But he who has achieved the top— 
All is the price of all. 


• 414 •

“Houses/* so the wise men tell me, 
“Mansions*'! Mansions must be warm. 
Mansions cannot let the tears in. 
Mansions must exclude the storm. 

“Many mansions” by “His Father”— 
I don't know him—snugly built. 
Could the children find the way there 
Some would even trudge tonight! 


• 415 • 

How far is it to heaven? 
As far as death this way. 
Of fathom or of league beyond 
Was no discovery. 

How far is it to hell? 
As far as death this way. 
How far left hand the sepulchre 
Defies topography. 


• 416 •

They leave us with the Infinite. 
But He is not a man, 
His fingers are the size of fists. 
His fists, the size of men. 

And whom He foundeth with His arm 
As Himmaleh shall stand, 
Gibraltar's everlasting shoe 
Poised lightly on his hand. 

So trust Him, comrade! You for you. 
And I, for you and me. 
Eternity is ample, 
And quick enough, if true. 


• 417 •

There is a zone whose even years 
No solstice interrupt. 
Whose sun constructs perpetual noon. 
Whose perfect seasons wait; 

Whose summer set in summer till 
The centuries of June 
And centuries of August fuse 
And consciousness is noon. 


• 418 •

Some we see no more, tenements of wonder 
Occupy, to us, though perhaps to them 
Simpler are the days than the supposition 
Their removing manners leave us to presume. 

That oblique belief which we call conjecture 
Grapples with a theme stubborn as sublime. 
Able as the dust to equip its feature. 
Adequate as drums to enlist the tomb. 


• 419 •

Not so the infinite relations. 
Below 
Division is adhesion's forfeit. 
On high 
Affliction but a speculation, 
And woe 
A fallacy, a figment 
We knew. 


• 420 •

This dust and its feature. 
Accredited today, 
Will in a second future 
Cease to identify. 

This mind and its measure 
A too minute area 
For its enlarged inspection's 
Comparison appear. 

This world and its species 
A too concluded show 
For its absorbed attention's 
Remotest scrutiny. 


• 421 •

You love the Lord you cannot see, 
You write Him every day 
A little note when you awake. 
And further in the day 

An ample letter—how you miss 
And would delight to see— 
But then, His house is but a step. 
And mine’s in heaven, you see. 


• 422 •

Of death I try to think like this: 
The well in which they lay us 
Is but the likeness of the brook 
That menaced, not to slay us. 
But to invite by that dismay 
Which is the zest of sweetness 
To the same flower Hesperian, 
Decoying but to greet us. 

I do remember when a child 
With bolder playmates straying 
To where a brook that seemed a sea 
Withheld us by its roaring 
From just a purple flower beyond 
Until, constrained to clutch it. 
Were doom itself the penalty. 
The bravest leaped and clutched it. 


• 423 • 

Aurora is the effort 
Of the celestial face 
Unconsciousness of perfectness 
To simulate, to us. 


• 424 • 

Of paradise' existence 
All we know 
Is the uncertain certainty. 
But its vicinity infer 
By its bisecting 
Messenger. 


• 425 •

Taking up the fair ideal 
Just to cast her down 
When a fracture we discover. 
Or a splintered crown, 

Makes the heavens portable 
And the gods a lie. 
Doubtless Adam scowled at Eden 
For his perjury! 

Cherishing our poor ideal 
Till in purer dress 
We behold her glorified, 
Comforts search like this. 

Till the broken creatures 
We adored for whole, 
Stains all washed, transfigured, mended. 
Meet us with a smile. 


• 426 •

Oh, future! Thou secreted peace 
Or subterranean woe. 
Is there no wandering route of grace 
That leads away from thee— 

No circuit sage of all the course 
Descried by cunning men. 
To balk thee of the innocence 
Advancing to thy den? 


• 427 •

Besides this May we know 
There is another. 
How fair our speculations 
Of the foreigner! 

Some know him whom we knew. 
Sweet wonder, a nature be 
Where saints and our plain-going neighbor 
Keep Mayl 


• 428 •

Image of light, adieu. 
Thanks for the interview 
So long—so short. 
Preceptor of the whole, 
Coeval Cardinal,
Impart, depart. 


• 429 •

There is a morn by men unseen. 
Whose maids upon remoter green 
Keep their seraphic May, 
And all day long, with dance and game 
And gambol I may never name. 
Employ their holiday. 

Here to light measure move the feet 
Which walk no more the village street 
Nor by the wood are found; 
Here are the birds that sought the sun 
When last year's distaff idle hung 
And summer's brows were bound. 

Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene. 
Ne'er such a ring on such a green. 
Nor so serene array— 
As if the stars some summer night 
Should swing their cups of chrysolite 
And revel till the day. 

Like thee to dance, like thee to sing. 
People upon that mystic green, 
I ask each new May morn. 
I wait thy far, fantastic bells 
Announcing me in other dells 
Unto the different dawnl 


• 430 •

If my bark sink 
'Tis to another sea . 24 
Mortality’s ground floor 
Is immortality. 


• 431 • 

The Infinite a sudden guest 
Has been assumed to be, 
But how can that stupendous come 
Which never went away? 

24 “If my bark sinks, *tis to another sea/' is the final line of “A Poet's Hope/' 
by William Ellery Channing. 


Vital Light 


• 432 • 

The poets light but lamps. 
Themselves go out; 
The wicks they stimulate, 
If vital light 

Inhere as do the suns. 
Each age a lens 
Disseminating their 
Circumference. 


• 433 •

The mind lives on the heart 
Like any parasite; 
If that be full of meat 
The mind is fat. 

But if the heart be lean, 
The stoutest mind will pine; 
Throw not to the divine 
Like dog a bone . 28 

28 This poem is given as it appears in Emily’s latest handwriting. An earlier 
version, of which there are three copies in writing of approximately the same 
date, was published in The New England Quarterly, April, 193s, with a 
different second stanza: 

But if the heart omit, 
Emaciate the wit. 
The aliment of it 
So absolute. 


• 434 •

Such are the inlets of the mind; 
His outlets would you see, 
Ascend with me the table-land 
Of immortality. 


• 435 • 

Your thoughts don't have words every day, 
They come a single time 
Like signal esoteric sips 
Of sacramental wine. 

Which while you taste so native seems. 
So bounteous, so free. 
You cannot comprehend its worth 
Nor its infrequency. 


• 436 •

“Shall I take thee?" the poet said 
To the propounded word. 
“Be stationed with the candidates 
Till I have further tried." 

The poet probed philology 
And when about to ring 
For the suspended candidate. 
There came unsummoned in 

That portion of the vision 
The word applied to fill. 
Not unto nomination 
The cherubim reveal. 
 

• 437 •

If ever the lid gets off my head 
And lets the brain away 
The fellow will go where he belonged 
Without a hint from me; 

And the world, if the world be looking on. 
Will see how far from home 
It is possible for sense to live. 
The soul there all the time. 


• 438 •

The spirit is the conscious ear, 
We actually hear 
When we inspect that's audible 
That is admitted here. 

For other purposes, as sound. 
There hangs a minor ear 
Outside the castle that contain, 
The other only hear. 


• 439 •

Who goes to dine must take his feast 
Or find the banquet mean; 
The table is not laid without 
Till it is laid within. 

For pattern is the mind bestowed 
That, imitating her. 
Our most ignoble services 
Exhibit worthier. 


• 440 •

To see the summer sky 
Is poetry 
Though never in a book it lie. 
True poems flee. 


• 441 •

The spry arms of the wind 
If I could crawl between, 
I have an errand imminent 
To an adjoining zone. 

I should not care to stop. 
My process is not long— 
The wind could wait without the gate 
Or stroll the town among— 

To ascertain the house. 
And if the soul’s within, 
And hold the wick of mine to it 
To light, and then return. 


• 442 •

This is a blossom of the brain, 
A small italic seed 
Lodged by design or happening— 
The spirit fructified. 

Shy as the wind of his chambers. 
Swift as a freshet’s tongue. 
So of the flower of the soul. 
Its process is unknown. 

When it is found, a few rejoice. 
The wise convey it home, 
Carefully cherishing the spot 
If other flower become. 

When it is lost, that day shall be 
The funeral of God, 
Upon His breast a closing soul, 
The flower of our Lord. 


• 443 •

Ideals are the fairy oil 
With which we help the wheel. 
But when the vital axle turns 
The eye rejects the oil. 


• 444 • 

Because my brook is fluent 
I know 'tis dry; 
Because my brook is silent 
It is the sea. 

And startled at its rising 
I try to flee 
To where the strong assure me 
Is “no more sea." 


• 445 •

The well upon the brook 
Were foolish to depend; 
Let brooks renew of brooks. 
But wells of failless groundl 


• 446 •

Estranged from beauty none can be 
For beauty is infinity. 
And power to be finite ceased 
When fate incorporated us. 


• 447 • 

The truth is stir less. Other force 
May be presumed to move. 
This then is best for confidence— 
When oldest cedars swerve 

And oaks unclinch their fists. 
And mountains feeble lean, 
How excellent a body 
That stands without a bone! 

How vigorous a force 
That holds without a prop! 
Truth stays herself, and every man 
That trusts her, boldly up. 


• 448 •

A man may drop a remark, 
In itself a quiet thing, 
That may furnish the fuse unto a spark 
In dormant nature lain. 

Let us deport with skill. 
Let us discourse with care, 
Powder exists in charcoal 
Before it exists in fire. 


• 449 • 

Tell all the truth but tell it slant. 
Success in circuit lies, 
Too bright for our infirm delight 
The truth's superb surprise; 

As lightning to the children eased 
With explanation kind. 
The truth must dazzle gradually 
Or every man be blind. 


• 450 •

Lift it, with the feathers 
Not alone we fly! 
Launch it, the aquatic 
Not the only seal 

Advocate the azure 
To the lower eyes; 
He has obligation 
Who has paradise. 


• 451 •

Once more my now bewildered dove 
Bestirs her puzzled wings; 
Once more her mistress on the deep 
Her troubled question flings; 

Thrice to the floating casement 
The Patriarch's bird returned— 
Courage, my brave Columba, 
There may yet be land I 


• 452 •

The fascinating chill that music leaves 
Is earth's corroboration 
Of ecstasy's impediment; 
'Tis rapture's germination 

In timid and tumultuous soil, 
A fine estranging creature 
To something upper wooing us. 
But not to our Creator. 


• 453 •

Dying at my music! 
Bubble! Bubble! 
Hold me till the octave's run! 
Quick! Burst the windows! 
Ritardando! 
Phials left, and the sun! 


• 454 •

Better than music, for I who heard it 9 
I was used to the birds before; 
This was different, 'twas translation 
Of all tunes I knew, and more; 

TTwasn’t contained like other stanza. 
No one could play it the second time 
But the composer, perfect Mozart, 
Perish with him that keyless rhyme! 

So children, assured that brooks in Eden 
Bubbled a better melody, 
Quaintly infer Eve's great surrender. 
Urging the feet that would not fly. 

Children matured are wiser, mostly, 
Eden a legend dimly told. 
Eve and the anguish grandame's story— 
But I was telling a tune I heard. 

Not such a strain the church baptizes 
When the last saint goes up the aisles. 
Not such a stanza shakes the silence 
When the redemption strikes her bells. 

Let me not lose its smallest cadence. 
Humming for promise when alone, 
Humming until my faint rehearsal 
Drop into tune around the throne! 


• 455 •

The beggar at the door for tame 
Were easily supplied, 
But bread is that diviner thing. 
Disclosed to be denied. 
 

• 456 •

A clover's simple fame 
Remembered of the cow 
Is sweeter than enameled realms 
Of notoriety. 

Renown perceives itself 
And that profanes the flower; 
The daisy that has looked behind 
Has compromised its power. 


• 457 •

Fame is the one that does not stay. 
Its occupant must die, 
Or out of sight of estimate 
Ascend incessantly, 

Or be that most insolvent thing, 
A lightning in the germ; 
Electrical the embryo 
Or findless is the flame. 


• 458 • 

Just as he spoke it from his hands 
This edifice remain; 
A turret more, a turret less. 
Dishonor his design. 

According as his skill prefer 
It perish or endure, 
Content, soe’er it ornament 
His absent character. 


• 459 • 

Fame is the tint that scholars leave 
Upon their setting names— 
The iris not of Occident 
That disappears as comes. 


• 460 •

He who in himself believes 
Fraud cannot presume. 
Faith is constancy’s result 
And assumes, from home. 

Cannot perish, though it fail 
Every second time. 
But defaced vicariously 
For some other shame. 


• 461 •

Fame of myself to justify! 
All other plaudit be 
Superfluous, an incense 
Beyond necessity. 

Fame of myself to lack, although 
My name be else supreme, 
This were an honor honorless, 
A futile diadem. 


• 462 •

The first we knew of him was death. 
The second was renown; 
Except the first had justified 
The second had not been. 


• 463 •

All men for honor hardest work 
But are not known to earn, 
Paid after they have ceased to work, 
In infamy or urn. 


That Campaign Inscrutable 


• 464 •

'Twas fighting for his life he was. 
That sort accomplish well, 
The ordnance of vitality 
Is frugal of its ball; 

It aims once, kills once, conquers once— 
There is no second war 
In that campaign inscrutable 
Of the interior. 


• 465 • 

The life we have is very great; 
The life that we shall see 
Surpasses it we know because 
It is infinity. 

But when all space has been beheld 
And all dominion shown. 
The smallest human heart’s extent 
Reduces it to none. 


• 466 • 

The sun is gay or stark 
According to our deed; 
If merry, he is merrier; 
If eager for the dead 

Or an expended day 
He helped to make too bright. 
His mighty pleasure suits us not. 
It magnifies our freight. 


• 467 •

Somewhat to hope for. 
Be it ne'er so far. 
Is capital against 
Despair. 

Somewhat to suffer. 
Be it ne'er so keen. 
If terminable, may 
Be borne. 


• 468 •

There is a strength in knowing that it can be borne 
Although it tear. 
What are the sinews of such cordage for 
Except to bear? 

The ship might be of satin had it not to fight. 
To walk on tides requires cedar feet. 


• 469 • 

Could hope inspect her basis 
Her craft were done, 
Has a fictitious charter 
Or she is none. 

Balked in the vastest instance 
But to renew. 
Felled by but one assassin, 
Prosperity. 


• 470 •

The way hope builds his house, 
It is not with a sill, 
Nor rafter has that edifice 
But only pinnacle; 

Abode in as supreme, 
This superficies. 
As if it were of ledges smit 
And mortised with the laws. 


• 471 •

The service without hope 
Is tenderest, I think, 
Because *tis unsustained 
By end-rewarded work; 

Has impetus of gain. 
And impetus of goal; 
There is no diligence like that 
That knows not an until. 


• 472 •

A solemn thing within the soul 
To feel itself get ripe 
And golden hang, while farther up 
The Maker's ladders stop, 
And in the orchard far below 
You hear a being drop; 

A wonderful, to feel the sun 
Still toiling at the cheek 
You thought was finished; cool of eye. 
And critical of work, 
He shifts the stem a little 
To give your core a look; 

But solemnest to know 
Your chance in harvest moves 
A little nearer; every sun 
The single, to some lives.

The soul has bandaged moments 
When too appalled to stir; 
She feels some ghastly fright come up 
And stop to look at her, 
Salute her with long fingers, 
Caress her freezing hair. 
Sip, goblin, from the very lips 
The lover hovered o'er— 
Unworthy that a thought so mean 
Accost a theme so fair. 

The soul has moments of escape 
When, bursting all the doors. 
She dances like a bomb abroad. 
And swings upon the hours 

As do the bee, delirious borne, 
Long dungeoned from his rose, 
Touch liberty—then know no more 
But noon and paradise. 

The soul’s retaken moments 
When, felon, led along 
With shackles on the plumed feet 
And rivets in the song, 
The horror welcomes her again— 
These are not brayed of tongue. 


• 474 • 

Nature sometimes sears a sapling, 
Sometimes scalps a tree; 
Her green people recollect it 
When they do not die. 

Fainter leaves to further seasons 
Dumbly testify; 
We who have the souls die oftener. 
Not so vitally. 


• 475 •

A pang is more conspicuous in spring 
In contrast with the things that sing— 
Not birds entirely, but minds. 
Minute effulgences and winds. 

When what they sung for is undone 
Who cares about a bluebird’s tune? 
Why, resurrection had to wait 
Till they had moved a stone! 


• 476 •

It is easy to work when the soul is at play. 
But when the soul is in pain, 
The hearing him put his playthings up 
Makes work difficult then. 

It is simple to ache in the bone or the rind. 
But gimlets among the nerve 
Mangle daintier, terribler, 
Like a panther in the glove. 


• 477 •

As one does sickness over 
In convalescent mind. 
His scrutiny of chances 
By blessed health obscured; 

As one rewalks a precipice. 
And whittles at the twig 
That held him from perdition 
Sown sidewise in the crag; 

A custom of the soul 
Far after suffering. 
Identity to handle, 
For evidence't has been. 


• 478 •

Dreams are the subtle dower 
That make us rich an hour. 
Then fling us poor 
Out of the purple door 
Into the precinct raw 
Possessed before. 


• 479 •

None who saw it ever told it, 
'Tis as hid as death. 
Had for that specific treasure 
A departing breath. 

Surfaces may be invested. F
Did the diamond grow 
General as the dandelion. 
Would you seek it so? 


• 480 •

Of the heart that goes in 
And closes the door 
Shall the playfellow heart complain. 
Though the ring is unwhole, 
And the company broke 
Can never be fitted again? 


• 481 •

The heart has narrow banks; 
It measures like the sea 
In mighty, unremitting bass 
And blue monotony, 

Till hurricane bisect. 
And as itself discerns 
Its insufficient area, 
The heart convulsive learns 

That calm is but a wall 
Of unattempted gauze 
An instant’s push demolishes, 
A questioning dissolves. 


• 482 •

Her sweet weight on my heart a night 
Had scarcely deigned to lie. 
When, stirring for beliefs delight. 
My bride had slipped away. 

If 'twas a dream, made solid just 
The heaven to confirm. 
Or if myself were dreamed of her. 
The wisdom to presume 

With Him remain, Who unto me 
Gave, even as to all, 
A fiction superseding faith 
By so much as 'twas real. 


• 483 •

Talk not to me of summer treesl 
The foliage of the mind 
A tabernacle is for birds 
Of no corporeal kind; 

And winds do go that way at noon 
To their ethereal homes, 
Whose bugles call the least of us 
To undepicted realms. 


• 484 •

We introduce ourselves 
To planets and to flowers, 
But with ourselves have etiquettes. 
Embarrassments and awes. 

 
• 485 •

Embarrassment of one another 
And God 
Is revelation’s caution. 
Aloud 
Is nothing that is chief, 
But still. 
Divinity dwells under seal. 


• 486 •

Death’s waylaying not the sharpest 
Of the thefts of time; 
There marauds a sorer robber. 
Silence is his name. 

No assault nor any menace 
Doth betoken him, 
But from life’s consummate cluster 
He supplants the balm . 20

• 487 •

The words the happy say 
Are paltry melody; 
But those the silent feel 
Are beautiful. 


• 488 •

There is no silence in the earth so silent 
As that endured 
Which, uttered, would discourage nature 
And haunt the world. 


• 489 •

Absence disembodies, so does death. 
Hiding individuals from the earth; 
Superstition helps, as well as love; 
Tenderness decreases as we prove. 


• 490 •

The loneliness one dare not sound. 
And would as soon surmise 
As in its grave go plumbing 
To ascertain the size; 

The loneliness whose worst alarm 
Is lest itself should see. 
And perish from before itself 
For just a scrutiny; 

The chasm not to be surveyed. 
But skirted in the dark, 
With consciousness suspended. 
And being under lock— 

I fear me this is loneliness. 
The Maker of the soul 
Its caverns and its corridors 
Illuminate or seal. 


• 491 •

Shame is the shawl of pink 
In which we wrap the soul 
To keep it from infesting eyes. 
The elemental veil 

Which helpless nature drops 
When pushed upon a scene 
Repugnant to her probity; 
Shame is the tint divine. 


• 492 •

Patience has a quiet outer; 
Patience, look within, 
Is an insect’s futile forces, 
Infinites between, 

'Scaping one against the other 
Fruitlesser to fling; 
Patience is the smile’s exertion 
Through the quivering. 


• 493 •

Grief is a mouse. 
And chooses wainscot in the breast 
For his shy house. 
And baffles quest. 

Grief is a thief, 
Quick startled, pricks his ear 
Report to hear of that vast dark 
That swept his being back. 


Grief is a juggler. 
Boldest at the play, 
Lest if he flinch. 
The eye that way 

Pounce on his bruises. 
One, say, or three. 
Grief is a gourmand, 
Span his luxury. 

Best grief is tongueless— 
Before hell tell. 
Burn him in the public square. 
His embers will. 

Possibly. If they refuse 
How then know, 
Since a rack couldn't coax 
A syllable now. 


• 494 •

There comes an hour when begging stops. 
When the long-interceding lips 
Perceive their prayer is vain. 

*‘Thou shalt not” is a kinder sword 
Than from a disappointing God, 
“Disciple, call again.” 


• 495 •

I have never seen volcanoes, 
But when travelers tell 
How those old phlegmatic mountains. 
Usually so still. 

Bear within appalling ordnance. 
Fire and smoke and gun. 
Taking villages for breakfast, 
And appalling men, 

If the stillness is volcanic 
In the human face 
When upon a pain Titanic 
Features keep their place; 

If at length the smouldering anguish 
Will not overcome, 
And the palpitating vineyard 
In the dust be thrown; 

If some loving antiquary 
On Resumption morn 
Will not cry with joy, “Pompeii!” 
To the hills return! 


• 496 •  

The joy that has no stem nor core. 
Nor seed that we can sow. 
Is edible to longing, 
But ablative to show. 

By fundamental palates 
Those products are preferred 
Impregnable to transit 
And patented by pod. 


• 497 •

Bliss is the plaything of the child. 
The lever of the man, 
The sacred stealth of boy and girl, 
Indict it if we cant 


• 498 •

In many and reportless places 
We feel a joy 
Reportless, also, but sincere as nature 
Or Deity. 

It comes without a consternation. 
Dissolves the same, 
But leaves a sumptuous destitution 
Without a name. 

Profane it by pursuit we cannot, 
It has no home. 
Nor we who, having once waylaid it. 
Thereafter roam. 


• 499 •

Purple is fashionable twice— 
This season of the year 
And when a soul perceives itself 
To be an emperor. 


• 500 •

Delight’s despair at setting 
Is that delight is less 
Than the sufficing longing 
That so impoverish. 

Enchantment's perihelion 
Mistaken oft has been 
For the authentic orbit 
Of its anterior sun. 


• 501 •

Lest this be heaven indeed 
An obstacle is given 
That always gauges a degree 
Between ourself and heaven. 


• 502 •

Sweet skepticism of the heart 
That knows and does not know. 
And tosses like a fleet of balm 
Affronted by the snow. 

Invites and then retards the truth 
Lest certainty be sere 
Compared with the delicious throe 
Of transport thrilled with fear. 


• 503 •

A stagnant pleasure like a pool 
That lets its rushes grow 
Until they heedless tumble in 
And make the water slow. 

Impeding navigation bright 
Of ripples going down— 
Yet even this shall rouse itself 
When freshets come along. 


• 504 •

Such is the strength of happiness 
The least can lift a ton 
Assisted by its stimulus; 
Who misery sustain 

No sinew can afford, 
The cargo of themselves 
Too infinite for consciousness' 
Benumbed abilities. 


• 505 •

There is an arid pleasure 
As different from joy 
As frost is different from dew; 
Like element are they. 

Yet one rejoices flowers, 
And one the flowers abhor; 
The finest honey curdled 
Is worthless to the bee. 


• 506 •

The auctioneer of parting, 
His “Going, going, gone," 
Shouts even from the crucifix 
And brings his hammer down. 

He only sells the wilderness. 
The prices of despair 
Range from a single human heart 
To two—not any more. 


• 507 •

The whole of it came not at once, 
’Twas murder by degrees, 
A thrust—and then for life a chance 
The bliss to cauterize. 

The cat reprieves the mouse 
She eases from her teeth 
Just long enough for hope to tease, 
Then mashes it to death. 

’Tis life's award to die, 
Contenteder if once, 
Than dying half, then rallying 
For consciouser eclipse. 


• 508 • 

Facts by our side arc never sudden 
Until they look around. 
And then they scare us like a specter 
Protruding from the ground. 

The height of our portentous neighbor 
We never know 
Till summoned to his recognition 
By an adieu— 

Adieu till when the wise cannot conjecture; 
The bravest die 
As ignorant of their resumption 
As you or I. 


• 509 • 

Crumbling is not an instant's act, 
A fundamental pause; 
Dilapidation's processes 
Are organized decays. 

'Tis first a cobweb on the soul, 
A cuticle of dust, 
A borer in the axis. 
An elemental rust. 

Ruin is formal, devil's work. 
Consecutive and slow— 
Fail in an instant no man did. 
Slipping is crash’s law. 


• 510 •

A doubt if it be us 
Assists the staggering mind 
In an extremer anguish 
Until it footing find; 

An unreality is lent, 
A merciful mirage, 
That makes the living possible 
While it suspends the lives. 


• 511 •

One anguish in a crowd, 
A minor thing it sounds 
And yet, unto the single doe 
Attempted of the hounds 

Tis terror as consummate 
As legions of alarm 
Did leap full-flanked upon the host 
'Tis units make the swarm. 

A small leech on the vitals. 
The sliver in the lung, 
The bung out of an artery. 
Are scarce accounted harms,

Yet mighty by relation 
To that repealless thing, 
A being, impotent to stop 
When once it has begun! 


• 512 •

As frost is best conceived 
By force of its result. 
Affliction is inferred 
By subsequent effect. 

If when the sun reveal. 
The garden keep the gash. 
If as the days resume, 
The wilted countenance 

Cannot efface the crease 
Or counteract the stain, 
Presumption is, vitality 
Was somewhere put in twain. 


• 513 •

One crucifixion is recorded only; 
How many be 
Is not affirmed of mathematics 
Or history. 

One Calvary exhibited to stranger; 
As many be 
As persons or peninsulas. 
Gethsemane 

Is but a province in the being’s center; 
India, 
For journey or crusade’s achieving. 
Too near. 

Our Lord indeed bore compound witness. 
And yet, 
There’s newer, nearer crucifixion 
Than that. 


• 514 •

One crown not any seek. 
And yet the highest head 
Its isolation coveted, 
Its stigma deified. 

While Pontius Pilate lives. 
In whatsoever hell. 
That coronation pierces him. 
He recollects it well. 


• 515 •

Time does go on, 
I tell it gay 
To those who suffer now; 
They shall survive! 
There is a sun! 
They don't believe it now. 


• 516 •

“Faithful to the end,” amended 
From the heavenly clause— 
Lucrative indeed the offer. 
But the heart withdraws. 

“I will give," the base proviso. 
Spare your “Crown of Life”! 
Those it fits too fair to wear it— 
Try it on yourself ! 27 

27 A somewhat different version of this poem was published in The New 
England Quarterly , April, 1932 : 

“Faithful to the end” amended 
From the heavenly clause, 
Constancy with a proviso 
Constancy abhors. 

“Crowns of life” are servile prizes 
To the stately heart. 
Given for the giving, solely, 
No emolument. 


• 517 •

An honest tear 
Is durabler than bronze. 
This cenotaph 
May each that dies. 

Reared by itself 
No deputy suffice. 
Gratitude bears 
When obelisk decays. 


An Ablative Estate 


• 518 •

That it will never come again 
Is what makes life so sweet. 
Believing what we don’t believe 
Does not exhilarate. 

That if it be, it be at best 
An ablative estate, 
This instigates an appetite 
Precisely opposite. 


• 519 •

Contained in this short life 
Are magical extents— 
The soul returning soft at night 
To steal securer thence 
As children strictest kept 
Turn soonest to the sea 
Whose nameless fathoms slink away 
Beside infinity. 

Contained in this short life 
Are terrible extents 
Discernible to not a friend 
Except omnipotence— 
A friend too straight to stoop. 
Too distant to be seen; 
"Come unto me,” enacted how. 
With firmaments between? 


• 520 •

How much the present moment means 
To those who’ve nothing more— 
The dog, the tramp, the atheist. 
Stake an entire store 

Upon a moment's shallow rim. 
While their commuted feet 
The torrents of eternity 
Do all but inundate. 


• 521 •

In this short life 
That only lasts an hour. 
How much, how little. 
Is within our power! 


• 522 •

Did life's penurious length 
Italicize its sweetness. 
The men that daily live 
Would stand so deep in joy 

That it would clog the cogs 
Of that revolving reason 
Whose esoteric belt 
Protects our sanity. 


• 523 •

Summer is shorter than any one. 
Life is shorter than summer; 
Seventy years is spent as quick 
As an only dollar. 

Sorrow is courteous and stays. 
See how well we spurn him, 
Equally to abhor delight. 
Equally retain him. 


• 524 •

Uncertain lease develops luster 
On time;
Uncertain grasp, appreciation 
Of sum. 

The shorter fate is oftener the chiefest 
Because 
Inheritors upon a tenure 
Prize. 


• 525 •

How human nature dotes 
On what it can't detect! 
The moment that a plot is plumbed 
Prospective is extinct. 

Prospective is the friend 
Reserved for us to know 
When constancy is clarified 
Of curiosity. 

Of subjects that resist, 
Redoubtablest is this: 
Where go we? Go we anywhere? 
Creation after this? 


• 526 •

Unto the whole how add? 
Has “all” a further realm. 
Or utmost an ulterior? 
Oh, subsidy of balm! 


• 527 •

When we stand on the tops of things 
And like the trees look down, 
The smoke all cleared away from it 
And [sunset ] 28 on the scene 

Just laying light, no soul will wink 
Except it have the flaw; 
The sound ones like the hills shall stand 
No lightning drives away. 

The perfect nowhere be afraid. 
They bear their tranquil heads 
When others dare not go at noon. 
Protected by their deeds. 

The stars dare shine occasionally 
Upon a spotted world, 
And suns go surer for their proof. 
As if an axle held. 

28 As no copy of this poem in Emily’s handwriting is at present accessible, 
I have supplied the word “sunset” to fill a blank in the copy made by Mrs. 
Todd. 


• 528 •

Between the form of life and life 
The difference is as big 
As liquor at the lip between 
And liquor in the jug; 

The latter excellent to have. 
But for ecstatic need 
The corkless is superior— 
I know, for I have tried. 


• 529 •

The things that never can come back are several— 
Childhood, some forms of hope, the dead; 
But joys, like men, may sometimes make a journey 
And still abide. 

We do not mourn for traveler or sailor. 
Their routes are fair, 
But think, enlarged, of all that they will tell us 
Returning here. 

“Here!” There are typic heres, foretold locations. 
The spirit does not stand. 
Himself at whatsoever fathom 
His native land. 


• 530 •

“Go tell it”—what a message! 
To whom is specified. 
Not murmur, not endearment. 
But simply we obeyed— 

Obeyed a lure, a longing? 
Oh, Nature, none of this! 
“To law,” said sweet Thermopylae, 
“Convey my dying kiss.” 


• 531 •

Yesterday is history 
Tis so far away. 
Yesterday is poetry, 
Tis philosophy. 

Yesterday is mystery. 
Where it is today 
While we shrewdly speculate 
Flutter both away. 


• 532 • 

A pit —but heaven over it. 
And heaven beside. 
And heaven abroad, 
And yet—a pit. 
With heaven over it. 

To stir would be to slip, 
To look would be to drop, 
To dream, to sap the prop 
That holds my chances up. 
Ah, pit! With heaven over it! 

The depth is all my thought, 
I dare not ask my feet; 
Twould start us where we sit 
So straight you’d scarce suspect 
It was a pit, with fathoms under it. 

It’s circuit just the same: 
Seed, summer, tomb. 
Who’s doom— 
To whom? 


• 533 •

We lose because we win. 
Gamblers, 
Recollecting which, 
Toss their dice againl 


• 534 • 

If wrecked upon the shoal of thought 
How is it with the sea? 
The only vessel that is shunned 
Is safe simplicity. 


• 535 •

That sacred closet when you sweep 
Entitled “Memory/' 
Select a reverential broom 
And do it silently. 

'Twill be a labor of surprise. 
Besides identity 
Of other interlocutors 
A probability. 

August the dust of that domain, 
Unchallenged let it lie; 
You cannot supersede itself, 
But it can silence you. 


• 536 •

Through those old grounds of memory 
The sauntering alone 
Is a divine intemperance 
A prudent man would shun. 

Of liquors that are vended 
*Tis easy to beware, 
But statutes do not meddle 
With the internal bar. 

Pernicious as the sunset. 
Permitting to pursue 
But impotent to gather. 
The tranquil perfidy 

Alloys our firmer moments 
With that severest gold. 
Convenient to the longing 
But otherwise withheld. 


• 537 •

No passenger was known to flee 
Who lodged a night in memory; 
That wily subterranean inn 
Contrives that none go out again. 


• 538 •

To flee from memory 
Had we the wings, 
Many would fly. 
Inured to slower things. 

Birds with surprise 
Would scan the mighty van 
Of men escaping 
From the mind of man. 


• 539 •

You cannot make remembrance grow 
When it has lost its root. 
The tightening the soil around 
And setting it upright 

Deceives perhaps the universe 
But not retrieves the plant; 
Real memory, like cedar feet, 
Is shod with adamant. 

Nor can you cut remembrance down 
When it shall once have grown, 
Its iron buds will sprout anew 
However overthrown. 


• 540 • 

Civilization spurns the leopard! 
Was the leopard bold? 
Deserts never rebuked her satin, 
Ethiop her gold. 

Tawny her customs she was conscious. 
Spotted, her dun gown, 
This was the leopard's nature. Signor, 
Need a keeper frown? 

Pity the pard that left her Asia! 
Memories of palm 
Cannot be stifled with narcotic. 
Nor suppressed with balm. 


• 541 •

To undertake is to achieve. 
Be undertaking blent 
With fortitude of obstacle 
And toward encouragement. 

That fine suspicion natures must 
Permitted to revere 
Departed standards and the few 
Criterion sources here . 20

What we see we know somewhat. 
Be it but a little;

Best things dwell out of sight— 
The pearl, the just, our thought; 

Most shun the public air 
Legitimate and rare; 

The capsule of the wind, 
The capsule of the mind, 

Exhibit here as doth a burr; 
Germ’s germ be where?

The days that we can spare 
Are those a function die, 
Or friend, or nature, stranded then 
In our economy.

Our ultimates a sham, 
We let go all of time without 
Arithmetic of him . 30

Smiling back from coronation 
May be luxury. 
On the heads that started with us— 
Being's peasantry— 

Recognizing in procession 
Ones we former knew 
When ourselves were also dusty 
Centuries ago, 

Had the triumph no conviction 
Of how many be 
Stimulated by the contrast 
Unto misery. 


• 547 •

Reportless subjects, to the quick 
Continual addressed. 
But foreign as the dialect 
Of Danes unto the rest. 

Reportless measures, to the ear 
Susceptive, stimulus.

To others, fabulous.

Which is the best, the moon or the crescent? 
Neither, said the moon. 
That is best which is not. Achieve it. 
You efface the sheen. 

Not of detention is fruition. 
Shudder to attain. 
Transport’s decomposition follows— 
He is prism born.


• 549 • 

Which is best? Heaven, 
Or only heaven to come, 
With that old codicil of doubt? 
I cannot help esteem 

The “bird within the hand” 
Superior to the one 
The “bush” may yield me—or may not— 
Too late to choose again.

Impossibility like wine 
Exhilarates the man 
Who tastes it; possibility 
Is flavorless. Combine 

A chance's faintest tincture. 
And in the former dram 
Enchantment makes ingredient 
As certainly as doom. 


• 551 •

Not to discover weakness is 
The mystery of strength; 
Impregnability inheres 
As much through consciousness 

Of faith of others in itself. 
As elemental nerve. 
Behind the most consummate clock 
What skillful pointers movel 


• 552 •

Satisfaction is the agent 
Of satiety; 
Want, a quiet commissary 
For infinity. 

To possess is past the instant

Peace is a fiction of our faith. 
The bells a winter night

The bird must sing to earn the crumb; 
What merit have the tune 
No breakfast if it guaranty? 
The rose, content may bloom 

To gain renown of lady’s drawer, 
But if the lady come 
But once a century, the rose 
Superfluous become.

A house upon the height 
That wagon never reached. 
No dead were ever carried down. 
No peddler’s cart approached; 

Whose chimney never smoked, 
Whose windows, night and morn, 
Caught sunrise first and sunset last. 
Then held an empty pane; 

Whose fate conjecture knew, 
No other neighbor did, 
And what it was we never lisped 
Because he never told.

The positive of bells. 
When cogs stop, that’s circumference— 
The ultimate of wheels.

In rags mysterious as these 
The shining courtiers go. 
Veiling the purple and the plumes, 
Veiling the ermine so; 

Smiling as they request an alms 
At some imposing door. 
Smiling when we walk barefoot 
Upon their golden floor 1

"Secrets” is a daily word 
Yet does not exist; 
Muffled, it remits surmise. 
Murmured, it has ceased. 

Dungeoned in the human breast 
Doubtless secrets lie, 
But that grate inviolate 
Comes nor goes away 

Nothing with an ear or tongue; 
Secrets stapled there 
Will decamp but once, and armed. 
To the sepulchre. 


• 560 •

Our little secrets slink away 
Beside God’s "will not tell”; 
He kept his word a trillion years 
And might we not as well 

But for the niggardly delight 
To make each other stare— 
Is there no sweet beneath the sun 
With this that may compare?

Banish air from air, 
Divide light if you dare. 
They’ll meet. 
While cubes in a drop 
Or pellets of shape 
Fit. 

Films cannot annul. 
Odors return whole. 
Force flame. 
And with a blonde push 
Over your impotence 
Flits steam. 


• 562 •

Air has no residence, no neighbor. 
No ear, no door, 
No apprehension of another— 
Oh, happy air! 

Ethereal guest at e’en an outcast’s pillow. 
Essential host in life’s faint wailing inn. 
Later than light thy consciousness accost me 
Till it depart, convoying mine. 


• 563 •


No man saw awe, nor to his house 
Admitted he a man. 
Though by his awful residence 
Has human nature been, 

Not deeming of his dread abode 
Till laboring to flee, 
A grasp on comprehension laid 
Detained vitality. 

Returning is a different route 
The spirit could not show, 
For breathing is the only work 
To be enacted now. 

“Am not consumed,” old Moses wrote, 
“Yet saw Him face to face.*’ 
That very physiognomy 
I am convinced was this. 


• 564 •

Power is a familiar growth. 
Not foreign, not to be, 
Beside us like a bland abyss 
In every company; 

Escape it, there is but a chance 
When consciousness and clay 
Lean forward for a final glance— 
Disprove that and you may. 


• 565 •

How many schemes may die 
In one short afternoon 
Entirely unknown 
To those they most concern: 

The man that was not robbed 
Because by accident 
He varied by a ribbon's width 
From his accustomed route; 

The love that would not try 
Because beside the door 
Some unsuspecting horse was tied 
Surveying his despair. 


• 566 •

Luck is not chance, 'tis toil; 
Fortune's expensive smile 
Is earned. 

The father of the mine 
Is that old-fashioned coin 
We spurned. 


• 567 •

Behold this little bane. 
The boon of all alive. 
As common as it is unknown. 
The name of it is love. 

To lack of it is woe, 
To own of it is wound— 
Not elsewhere, if in paradise, 
Its tantamount be found. 


• 568 • 

When a lover is a beggar 
Abject is his knee; 
When a lover is an owner 
Different is he. 

What he begged is then the beggar, 
Oh, disparityl 
Bread of heaven resents bestowal 
Like an obloquy. 
 

• 569 •

How fleet, how indiscreet an one. 
How always wrong is love— 
The joyful little deity 
We are not scourged to serve! 


• 570 •

Love is that later thing than death. 
More previous than life. 
Confirms it at its entrance and 
Usurps it of itself; 

Tastes death, the first to prove the sting. 
The second, to its friend. 
Disarms the little interval, 
Deposits him with God. 

Then hovers, an inferior guard. 
Lest this beloved charge 
Need, once in an eternity, 
A lesser than the large. 


• 571 •

Love can do all but raise the dead; 
I doubt if even that 
From such a giant were withheld 
Were flesh equivalent. 

But love is tired and must sleep. 
And hungry and must graze. 
And so abets the shining fleet 
Till it is out of gaze. 


• 572 •

Floss won't save you from an abyss. 
But a rope will, 
Notwithstanding a rope for a souvenir 
Does not look as well. 

But I tell you every step is a sluice, 
And every stop a well. 
Now will you have the rope or the floss? 
Prices reasonable. 


• 573 •

Experiment escorts us last. 
His pungent company 
Will not allow an axiom 
An opportunity. 


• 574 • 

Risk is the hair that holds the tun 
Seductive in the air; 
That tun is hollow, but the tun 
With hundred-weights to spare. 

Too ponderous to suspect the snare. 
Espies that fickle chair 
And seats itself to be let go 
By that perfidious hair. 

The “foolish tun,” the critics say. 
While that delusive hair, 
Persuasive as perdition, 
Decoys its passenger. 


• 575 •

Surprise is like a thrilling pungent 
Upon a tasteless meat— 
Alone too acrid, but combined, 
An edible delight. 


• 576 • 

The riddle we can guess 
We speedily despise. 
Not anything is stale so long 
As yesterday’s surprise. 


• 577 •

Circumference, thou bride of awe. 
Possessing, thou shalt be 
Possessed by every hallowed knight 
That dares to covet thee. 


• 578 •

To mend each tattered faith 
There is a needle fair; 
Though no appearance indicate, 
Tis threaded in the air; 

And though it do not wear 
As if it never tore, 
Tis very comfortable indeed. 
And specious as before. 


• 579 • 

Until the desert knows 
That water grows 
His sands suffice; 
But let him once suspect 
That Caspian fact, 
Sahara dies. 

Utmost is relative. 
Have not or have 
Adjacent sums; 
Enough, the first abode 
On the familiar road 
Galloped in dreams. 


• 580 • 

To one denied to drink 
To tell what water is 
Would be acuter, would it not. 
Than letting him surmise? 

To lead him to the well 
And let him hear it drip, 
Remind him would it not somewhat 
Of his condemned lip? 


• 581 •

Wonder is not precisely knowing, 
And not precisely knowing not, 
A beautiful but bleak condition 
He has not lived who has not felt. 

Suspense is his maturer sister; 
Whether adult delight is pain 
Or of itself a new misgiving— 
This is the gnat that mangles men. 


• 582 •

I know suspense, it steps so terse 
And turns so weak away; 
Besides, suspense is neighborly 
When I am riding by. 

Is always at the window 
Though lately I descry, 
And mention to my horses. 
The need is not of me. 


• 583 •

As old as woe—how old is that? 
Some eighteen thousand years. 
As old as bliss—how old is that? 
They are of equal years. 

Together chiefly they are found. 
But seldom side by side,
From neither of them though he try 
Can human nature hide. 


• 584 • 

God is indeed a jealous God, 
He cannot bear to see 
That we had rather not with Him 
But with each other play. 


• 585 •


Too happy time dissolves itself 
And leaves no remnant by; 

’Tis anguish not a feather hath. 
Or too much weight to fly. 


• 586 • 

Kill your balm, and its odors bless you; 
Bare your jessamine to the storm, 
And she will fling her maddest perfume 
Haply your summer night to charm. 

Stab the bird that built in your bosom. 
Oh, could you catch her last refrain— 
Bubble—“Forgive”—“Some better”—bubble— 
“Carol for him when I am gonel” 


• 587 •

How news must feel when traveling— 
If news have any heart— 
Alighting at the dwelling 
’Twill enter like a dartl 

What news must think when pondering— 
If news have any thought— 
Concerning the stupendousness 
Of its perceiveless freight! 

What news will do when every man 
Shall comprehend as one. 
And not in all the universe 
A thing to tell remain? 


• 588 •

Witchcraft was hung in history; 
But history and I 
Find all the witchcraft that we need 
Around us every day. 


• 589 • 

Faith slips and laughs and rallies. 
Blushes, if any see. 
Plucks at a twig of evidence, 
And asks a vane the way. 

Much gesture from the pulpit, 
Strong hallelujahs roll— 
Narcotics cannot still the tooth 
That nibbles at the soul. 31 

81 In Mrs. Todd’s copy, this is the conclusion of an eight-stanza poem, the 
third of three poems combined as one: the first, “After great pain a formal 
feeling comes,” Further Poems of Emily Dickinson , 1929, p. 175; the second, 
“This world is not conclusion,” Poems , Third Series, 1896, p. 159. When 
all of Emily’s manuscripts are available it may be possible to determine 
whether or not these three poems, now published separately, belong to¬ 
gether. 


• 590 •

As subtle as tomorrow 
That never came— 
A warrant, a conviction, 
Yet but a name. 


• 591 •

I'd rather recollect a setting 
Than own a rising sun— 
Though one is beautiful forgetting 
And real the other one— 

Because in going is a drama 
Staying cannot confer; 
To die divinely once a twilight 
Than live is easier. 


• 592 •

None can experience stint 
Who bounty have not known; 
The fact of famine could not be 
Except for fact of corn. 

Want is a meager art 
Acquired by reverse; 
The poverty that was not wealth 
Cannot be indigence. 


• 593 •

On that specific pillow 
Our projects flit away, 
The night’s tremendous morrow. 
And whether sleep will stay 

Or usher us, a stranger. 
To comprehension new, 
The effort to comprise it 
Is all the soul can do. 


• 594 • 

You cannot take itself 
From any human soul; 
That indestructible estate 
Enable him to dwell 

Impregnable as light 
That every man behold. 
But take away as difficult 
As undiscovered gold. 


• 595 •

To own the art within the soul. 
The soul to entertain 
With silence as a company 
And festival maintain 

In an unfurnished circumstance. 
Possession is to one 
As an estate perpetual, 
Or a reduceless mine. 


• 596 •

Of consciousness, her awful mate. 
The soul cannot be rid; 
As easy the secreting her 
Behind the eyes of God. 

The deepest hid is sighted first. 
And scant to Him the crowd; 
What triple lenses burn upon 
The escapade from God! 


• 597 •

As from the earth the light balloon 
Asks nothing but release— 
Ascension that for which it was, 
Its soaring residence— 

The spirit turns upon the dust 
That fastened it so long 
With indignation, as a bird 
Defrauded of its song. 


• 598 • 

I never hear that one is dead. 
Without the chance of life 
Afresh annihilating me. 
That mightiest belief. 

Too mighty for the daily mind 
That, tilling its abyss. 
Had madness, had it once or twice. 
The yawning consciousness. 

Beliefs are bandaged, like the tongue 
When terror, were it told 
In any tone commensurate, 
Would strike us instant dead. 

I do not know the man so bold 
He dare in secret place 
That awful stranger, consciousness. 
Look squarely in the face. 


• 599 •

Those, dying then, knew where they went. 
They went to God’s right hand; 
That hand is amputated now 
And God cannot be found. 

The abdication of belief 
Makes the behavior small - 
Better an ignis fatuus 
Than no illume at all. 


PART TWO 


Poems Incomplete or Unfinished 


• 603 • 

How soft a caterpillar steps! 
I find one on my hand; 
From such a velvet world it came. 
Such plushes at command, 
[Its journey never wakes my hand 
Till poising for a turn] 1 
Its soundless travels just arrest 
My slow terrestrial eye— 
Intent upon its circuit quaint 
What use has it for me? 

l In Emily's manuscript lines 5 and 6 are crossed out. 


• 604 • 

The merchant of the picturesque 
A counter has and sales. 
But is within or negative 
Precisely as the calls. 

To children he is small in price 
And large in courtesy; 
It suits him better than a check. 
Their artless currency. 

Of counterfeits he is so shy 
Do one advance so near 
As to behold his ample flight
. . . .


• 605 • 

The first day that I was a life 
I recollect it—how still! 
The last day that I was a life 
I recollect it as well. 

’Twas stiller, though the first 
Was still. 
’Twas empty, but the first 
Was full. 

This was my finalest occasion. 
But then. 
My tenderer experiment 
Toward men. 

“Which choose?” 
That I cannot say. 
“Which choose they?” 
Question memoryl 


• 606 • 

Arrows enamored of his breast 
Forgot to rankle there. 
And venoms he mistook for balms 
Renounced their character. 

He bowed to nothing but delight. 
Which . . . 
Of injury too innocent 
To know it when it passed. 


• 607 • 

Each scar I’ll keep for him. 
Instead I’ll say of gem 
In his long absence worn 
A costlier one. 

But every tear I bore, 
Were he to count them o'er. 
His own would fall so more 
I’ll mis-sum them. 


• 608 • 

He strained my faith—did he find it supple? 
Shook my strong trust—did it then yield? 
Hurled my belief—but did he shatter it? 
Racked with suspense, not a nerve failed! 

Wrung me with anguish—must be I deserved it. 
Though for what wrong he did never say. 
Stabbed—while I sued his sweet forgiveness. 
Jesus, it’s your little “John”! Why me slay? 2 

2 In Mrs. Todd's copy the last two words are inverted. 


• 609 • 

’Tis seasons since the dimpled war 
In which we each were conqueror 
And each of us were slain. 

And centuries 'twill be and more 
Another massacre before 
So modest and so vain. 

Without a formula we fought. 
Each was to each the pink redoubt 
. . . .


• 610 •

Knows how to forget! 
But could she teach it? 
’Tis the art most of all 
I should like to know. 

Long at its Greek 
I who pored patient 
Rise still the dunce 
God used to know. 

Mold my slow mind 
To this comprehension 
Oddest of sciences 
Book ever con. 

How to forget! 
Ah, to attain it 
I would give you 
All other love. 8 

8 For a different poem with the same first line see p. 1 lfi. 


• 611 •

She could not live upon the past 
The present did not know her. 
And so she sought this sweet at last 
And nature gently owned her— 

The mother that has not a knell 
For either duke or robin. 


• 612 •

Were it but me that gained the height, 
Were it but they that failed! 
How many things the dying play. 
Might they but live, they would! 


• 613 •

Perhaps I asked too large, 
I take no less than skies, 
For earths grow thick as berries 
In my native town. 

My basket holds just firmaments. 
Those dangle easy on my arm. 
But smaller bundles cram. 


• 614 • 

It don’t sound so terrible, quite, as it did. 
I run it over, "Dead”—brain—"dead!” 
Put it in Latin left of my school. 
Seems it don’t shriek so, under rule. 

Turn it a little—full in the face 
A trouble looks bitterest—shift it just— 
Say, "When tomorrow comes this way 
I shall have waded down one day.” 

I suppose it will interrupt me some 
Till I get accustomed; but then, the tomb 
Like other new things shows largest then. 
And smaller by habit. It’s shrewder then 
Put the thought in advance a year. 
How like "a fit” then murder wear ! 4 

4 "On the death of Lincoln?” M.L.T. 


• 615 • 

Above oblivion’s tide there is a pier. 
And an effaceless “few” are lifted there. 
Nay, lift themselves, fame has no arms 
And but one smile, inlaid with balms. 

[Above oblivion’s tide there is a pier. 
And the effaceless “few”] are scattered there; 
Scattered, I say! To place them side by side, 
Enough will not be found when all have died . 5 

8 If the words in brackets are supplied in place of four long dashes in 
Emily’s manuscript, this may be considered either a poem of two stanzas 
with the same opening lines, or a quatrain of which there are two versions. 


• 616 • 

Paradise is that old mansion 
Many owned before, 
Occupied by each an instant. 
Then reversed the door. 

Bliss is frugal of her leases, 
Adam thought her thrift 
Bankrupt once through his excesses— 
. . . .


• 617 • 

You’re right, “the way is narrow,” 
And “difficult the gate,” 
And “few there be”—correct again— 
That “enter in thereat.” 

’Tis costly—so are purples! 
’Tis just the price of breath! 
With but the discount of the grave, 
Termed by the brokers “death”! 

And after that there’s heaven, 
The good man’s dividend, 
And bad men go to jail, I guess, 
. . . .


• 618 • 

When what they sung for is undone 
Who cares about a bluebird’s tuner* 
Why, resurrection had to wait 
Till they had moved a stone. 

As if the drums went on and on 
To captivate the slain— 
I dare not write until I hear— 
When what they sung for is undone . 6 

6 The first of these stanzas is also the second of a two-stanza poem beginning, 
“A pang is more conspicuous in spring,” p. 245. The above fragment was 
written after “A pang," but both are in the writing of the eighties. 


• 619 •

My reward for being was this, 
My premium, my bliss. 
An admiralty less, 
A scepter penniless, 
And realms just dross. 

When thrones accost my hands 
With “Me, Miss, me," 
I’ll unroll thee. 
Dominions dowerless 

Beside this grace; 
Election, vote, 
The ballots of eternity 
Will show just that. 7 

7 In another copy of this enigmatical poem the second stanza reads: 

When thrones accost my hands 
With “Me, Miss, me,’* 

I’ll unroll thee— 

Sufficient dynasty. 

Creation powerless 
To peer this grace. 

Empire, state, 

Too little dust 
To dower so great. 

The original manuscript might indicate whether this is in reality an 
alternative second stanza, or merely a group of alternative lines. For instance. 

Dominions dowerless 
Beside this grace 

and 

Creation powerless 
To peer this grace 

might be alternatives to 

A scepter penniless 
And realms just dross. 

In any event, here is raw material on the way to becoming a great poem. 


• 620 •

To earn it by disdaining it 
Is fame’s consummate fee. 
He seeks what shuns him—look behind. 
He is pursuing thee! 

So let us gather every day. 
The aggregate of life’s bouquet 
Be honor and not shame. 

8 Dashes appear in the manuscript. 


• 621 • 

The lassitudes of contemplation 
Beget a force; 
They are the spirit’s still vacation 
That him refresh. 

The dreams consolidate in action, 
What mettle fair 

9 This poem is written on a strip of paper twenty-one inches long by 
three-quarters of an inch wide. 


• 622 • 

Why should we hurry? Why, indeed. 
When every way we fly 
We are molested equally 
By immortality? 
No respite from the inference 
That this which is, began, 
Though where its labors lie, 
A bland uncertainty 
Besets the sight 
This mighty night. 


Fragments 


• 623 •

Soft as the massacre of suns 
By evening's sabres slain. 


• 624 • 

Soul, take thy risksl 
With death to be 
Were better than 
Be not with theel 10 

10 This fragment is written on a scrap of paper measuring less than two 
by four inches. On the reverse is a touching little pencil sketch of a tomb, 
stone among tall grasses. 


• 625 • 

With thee in the desert! 
With thee in the thirst! 
With thee in the tamarind wood! 
Leopard breathes—at last! 


• 626 •

Let me not thirst with this hock at my lip. 
Nor beg, with domains in my pocket— 


• 628 •

Pausing against our palsied faces 
Time's decision shook. 11 

11 This fragment, written on a slip of paper less than an inch wide, might 
be the germ out of which grew poem 267, “We talked with each other 
about each other.** Both are in the handwriting of the eighties. 


• 629 •

Paradise is of the option. 
Whosoever will 
Dwell in Eden, notwithstanding 
Adam and repeal. 


• 630 • 

Is immortality a banc 
That men are so oppressed? 


• 631 • 

But silence is infinity, 
Himself have not a face. 


• 632 • 

Lest they should come is all my fear 
When sweet incarcerated here— 


• 633 •

The blood is more showy than the breath 
But cannot dance as well. 


• 634 •

Society for me my misery 
Since gift of thee. 


• 635 •

Or fame erect her siteless citadel . 12 

12 The two unrelated fragments 634 and 635 are written on the tom-off flap 
of an envelope.


• 636 • 

Fame’s boys and girls who never die, 
And are too seldom born— 


Poems Personal and Occasional 


• 637 •

You love me? You are sure? 
I shall not fear mistake? 
I shall not cheated wake 
Some grinning morn 
To find the sunrise left 
And orchards unbereft 
And Dollie 13 gone? 

I need not start? You’re sure 
That night will never be 
When, frightened, home to thee I run 
To find the windows dark 
And no more Dollie—mark!— 
Quite none? 

Be sure you’re sure you know! 
I’ll bear it better now 
If you’ll just tell me so 
Than when, a little dull balm grown 
Over this pain of mine. 
You sting again! 

1* "Dollie” was Emily's pet name for a friend as yet unidentified. 


• 638 • 

Distrustful of the gentian, 
And just to turn away, 
The fluttering of her fringes 
Chid my perfidy. 
Weary for my- 
I will singing go; 
I shall not feel the sleet then, 
I shall not fear the snow. 

Flees so the phantom meadow 
Before the breathless bee, 
So bubble brooks in deserts 
On ears that dying lie. 
Burn so the evening spires 
To eyes that closing go. 
Hangs so distant heaven 
To a hand below. 14 

14 A long dash in the fifth line of the manuscript apparently indicates 
space for a name. This poem was written in the sixties, like “All these my 
banners be," p. 45, and on the back of the same sheet. That poem has a 
couplet at the bottom of the page. After this one also there is a short 
stanza, “We lose because we win,” which appears as a separate poem on 
p. *71.


• 639 •

What shall I do it whimpers so— 
This little hound within the heart— 
All day and night with bark and start. 
And yet it will not go? 

Would you untie it were you me? 
Would it stop whining if to thee 
I sent it, even now? 

It should not tease you, by your chair. 
Or on the mat, or if it dare 
To climb your dizzy knee. 

Or sometimes at your side to run 
When you were willing—shall it come? 
Tell Carlo—he’ll tell me! 


• 640 •

If this is “fading/' 
Oh, let me immediately fade! 
If this is “dying,” 
Bury me in such a shroud of red! 

If this is “sleep,” 
On such a night 
How proud to shut the eyel 
Good evening, gentle fellow men, 
Peacock presumes to die I 


• 641 •

I shall not murmur if at last 
The ones I loved below 
Permission have to understand 
For what I shunned them so— 

Divulging it would rest my heart 
But it would ravage theirs— 
Why, Katie, treason has a voice. 
But mine dispels in tears. 


• 642 •

Dying, dying in the night! 
Won't somebody bring the light 
So I can see which way to go 
Into the everlasting snow? 

And Jesus, where is Jesus gone? 
They said that Jesus always came; 
Perhaps he doesn't know the house— 
This way, Jesus! Let him pass! 

Somebody run to the great gate 
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait— 
I hear her feet upon the stair! 
Death won't hurt now Dollie's here! 


• 643 •

I often passed the village 
When going home from school. 
And wondered what they did there 
And why it was so still. 

I did not know the year then 
In which my call would come— 
Earlier by the dial 
Than the rest have gone. 

It’s stiller than the sundown. 
It’s cooler than the dawn, 
The daisies dare to come here 
And birds can flutter down. 

So when you are tired, 
Or perplexed, or cold, 
Trust the loving promise 
Underneath the mold. 
Cry “It’s I! Take Dolliel” 
And I will enfold. 


• 644 • 

By chivalries as tiny, 
A blossom or a book. 
The seeds of smiles are planted 
Which blossom in the dark. 


• 645 • 

Apology for her 
Be rendered by the bee; 
Herself, without a parliament. 
Apology for me. 


• 646 • 

Be mine the doom— 
Sufficient fame 
To perish in her hand! 


• 647 • 

Betrothed to righteousness might be 
An ecstasy discreet, 
But nature relishes the pinks 
Which she was taught to eat. 


• 648 •

Brother of ingots —ah, Peru, 
Empty the hearts that purchased you! 


• 649 • 

By such and such an offering 
To Mr. So and So 
The web of life is woven— 
So martyrs’ albums show. 


• 650 • 

Dominion lasts until obtained. 
Possession just as long. 
But these, endowing as they flit. 
Eternally belong. 

How everlasting are the lips 
Known only to the dew! 
These are the brides of permanence. 
Supplanting me and you. 15

Published in The New England Quarterly , April, 1932. 


• 651 •

Her little parasol to lift 
And once to let it down 
Her whole responsibility— 
To imitate, be mine. 

A summer further I must wear. 
Content if nature's drawer 
Present me from sepulchral crease 
As blemishless as her. 
—With a morning-glory 


• 652 • 

I could bring you jewels 
Had I a mind to. 
But you have enough 
Of those; 

I could bring you odors 
From San Domingo, 
Colors 
From Vera Cruz. 

Berries of the Bahamas have I, 
But this little blaze 
Flickering to itself in the meadow 
Suits me more than those. 

Never a fellow matched this topaz 
And his emerald swing, 
Dower itself for Bobadilla— 
Better could I bring? 
—With jewel weed 
 

• 653 •

I keep my pledge, 
I was not called, 
Death did not notice me. 
I bring my rose, 
I plight again 
By every sainted bee, 
By daisy called from hillside. 
By bobolink from lane, 
Blossom and I— 
Her oath and mine— 
Will surely come again! 


• 654 •

If it had no pencil 
Would it try mine— 
Worn, now, and dull, sweet. 
Writing much to thee. 

If it had no word, 
Would it make the daisy 
Most as big as I was 
When it plucked me? 15

It would not know if it were spurned. 
This gallant little flower. 
How therefore safe to be a flower 
If one would tamper there! 

To enter, it would not aspire; 
But may it not despair 
That it is not a cavalier, 
To dare and perish there?

Least rivers 
Docile to some sea— 
My Caspian, thee.

Lethe in my flower 
Of which they who drink 
In the fadeless orchards 
Hear the bobolink. 

Merely flake or petal 
As the eye beholds. 
Jupiter! My father! 
I perceive the rose!

Many cross the Rhine 
In this cup of mine— 
Sip old Frankfort air 
From my brown cigar.

My heart upon a little plate 
Her palate to delight 
A berry or a bun would be, 
Might it an apricot!

My season’s furthest flower 
I tenderer commend 
Because I found her kinsmanless— 
A grace without a friend.

Of Brussels it was not; 
Of Kidderminster? Nay, 
The winds did buy it of the woods. 
They sold it unto me. 

It was a gentle price 
The poorest could afford; 
It was within the frugal purse 
Of beggar or of bird. 

Of small and spicy yards, 
In hue a mellow dun, 
Of sunshine and of sere composed, 
But princip’ly of sun. 

The wind unrolled it fast. 
And spread it on the ground— 
Upholst’rer of the pines is he, 
Upholst’rer of the pond.

Partake as doth the bee, 
Abstemiously; 
A rose is an estate 
In Sicily.

She dwelleth in the ground 
Where daffodils abide. 
Her Maker her metropolis, 
The universe her maid. 

To fetch her grace and awe 
And fairness and renown, 
The firmament’s—to pluck her 
And fetch her thee, be mine. 
—With a crocus

Their dappled importunity 
Disparage or dismiss; 
The obloquies of etiquette 
Are obsolete to bliss. 


• 665 •

Warm in her hand these accents lie 
While faithful and afar 
The grace so awkward for her sake 
Its fond subjection wear.

Where roses would not dare to go 
What heart would risk the way? 
And so I send my crimson scouts 
To sound the enemy.
