FOREWORD 


No reader or student of Emily Dickinson needs to be told 
that the appearance of this book is an event of large importance. 
Several hundred hitherto unpublished works by one of the great 
poets of the world—almost any claim for such an event would 
amount to understatement. But in the present case there is the 
special interest, both literary and general, which attaches to any 
news of Emily Dickinson. For Mrs. Bingham’s book is news of 
that mysterious person and that great poet, and it is news on so 
impressive a scale that one may well hesitate to improvise a 
statement of its value. The value of a fine poem—and many 
here are among Emily Dickinson’s finest, even after years during 
which it might have been supposed that all the best were out— 
is scarcely to be stated anyhow. Such a poem states itself, as 
these immediately will to scholars, to poets, and to laymen in 
America who understand that Emily Dickinson is great not 
merely in their country but everywhere. 

The task of editing her, as scholars at least are sure to know, 
is both a tease and a torment. The materials, the manuscripts, 
are either chaotic or elusive; sometimes they require so many 
decisions by the editor as to constitute him, provided his choices 
are wise, a poet himself; sometimes they seem to be clearer than 
they are, so that days of reflection will be necessary before a 
comma stays in or goes out. The breaking of lines, the dividing 
of stanzas, the working out of alternative phrases or words— 
these are but a few of the jobs to be done. Mrs. Bingham in her 
introduction has described them all with an accuracy which I 
am able to attest. It has been my privilege to watch Mrs. Bing¬ 
ham at work upon these poems, and it is my pleasure to say 
how much I admire the quality no less than the quantity of her

devotion. Her mother, Mrs. Todd, was Emily Dickinson's first 
editor. She was superb in the role and Mrs. Bingham has every¬ 
where been faithful to the challenge she inherited. The reader 
may have confidence that no problem has been skimped. Errors 
are always possible; Mrs. Bingham, I imagine, would be the last 
person to suggest that none had been made in this volume. But 
I can be witness to her sincere desire that the materials for their 
correction should be at the disposal of any student with a luckier 
eye or ear. 

It is of course to be regretted that almost sixty years should 
have passed before poems of such distinction and beauty became 
available to the world. Emily Dickinson died in 1886. But all of 
that is a story in itself. Meanwhile, and finally, here the poems 
are.

INTRODUCTION 


Your thoughts don't have words every day. 
They come a single time 
Like signal esoteric sips 
Of sacramental wine, 

Which while you taste so native seems, 

So bowiteous, so free. 

You cannot comprehend its worth. 

Nor its infrequency. 


JLhe poems of Emily Dickinson were not published during her 
lifetime. It was only after her death in 1886 that the manuscripts 
were found by her sister Lavinia at whose request my mother, 
Mabel Loomis Todd, undertook the task of publication. With 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson she brought out the first volume, 
containing 116 poems, in 1890, and Poems , Second Series, in 
1891. Without his help she published two volumes of letters, con¬ 
taining more than a hundred additional poems, in 1894, and 
Poems, Third Series, in 1896. Then, abruptly, her work stopped. 
Why? The answer to that question involves a long story. It is 
necessary to say here only that my mother had been alienated 
because of an irrelevant episode, a lawsuit about a strip of land 
brought against her by Lavinia Dickinson. As a consequence, 
nearly half of Emily's poems have remained unpublished to 
this day. The manuscripts which my mother was in process of 
preparing for the printer, together with all other documents relat¬ 
ing to the Dickinson family, were put away—out of sight. For her 
it was the end of a chapter, one which she hoped to forget. 

All these papers were packed in a camphor-wood chest. The 
lock, as you turn the key, plays a little tune. After the trial my 
mother locked the chest. It was not opened again until 1929 when, 

vii

at her request, and with thumping heart, I turned the key and 
for the first time heard that little tune. What I might find within 
I did not know. 

I looked and caught my breath. For there, before my eyes, were 
quantities of Emily's poems. How could they have kept quiet so 
long? With such inherent vitality it seemed as if they must have 
shouted, lying there in the dark all those yearsl 

I closed the lid, locked the chest, and tried to take in the signif¬ 
icance of what I had seen. 

Students of Emily's poetry, disturbed by legends springing 
up about her, legends without basis of fact, had for several years 
been urging my mother to do something about it. But she refused. 
She was reluctant to return to the past. It was only after growing 
insistence from scholars that, mastering the ache of a lifetime, 
she finally consented to take up again the trail of long ago. 

In order to straighten out the record the first step was to bring 
out a new edition of the 1894 Letters of Emily Dickinson since 
those volumes furnished the basis for an understanding of her 
life. Out of print for more than a generation, they must be made 
once more available. The new edition was published in 1931 
and again took its place as the standard source book on the 
subject. 1 

We next planned a volume of previously unpublished poems. 
But the way should be prepared for so important a volume. The 
second step, therefore, must be a fully documented account of 
why publication ceased in 1896 and was not resumed by my 
mother. As a beginning, she and I read together her letters from 
Colonel Higginson and from the publishers, as well as all other 
correspondence about the original editing. That second step was 
halted midway. My mother died suddenly on October 14, 1932. 

Of the reasons for the interruption of my mother's work in 
1896 I had at the time of her death only the haziest idea. She 
did not talk about Dickinson relationships and animosities. It 
has required years to accumulate bits of information from widely 
scattered sources, to fit the story together piece by piece, and to

verify every fact before accepting it as part of the narrative. But 
the second step has at last been taken. The story of ‘‘Emily 
Dickinson's literary debut," as my mother called it, has now been 
told. 2 

The present volume is the third step. 

To return to the year 1929 and the camphor-wood chest. When 
I examined the contents—diaries, letters, and other Dickinson 
documents—I found also hundreds of poems. Some of them had 
been published, but many more were unpublished, including 
all those in this book. 

The manuscripts of the poems were of two sorts: those Emily 
herself had worked over, and those which she had not touched 
since they were first captured in words—the “esoteric sips of 
sacramental wine." She had early begun to copy her poems and 
to destroy the rough drafts. She wrote them in ink on sheets of 
letter paper measuring five by eight inches. When she had filled 
five or six double sheets, she would make two pin-holes in the 
left margin and insert a piece of string, tying the sheets together 
in neat little fascicles which Lavinia called “volumes." This is 
the only way Emily tied up her poems. She never rolled them. 
Written at first in a fine running hand, the penmanship tends 
more and more to resemble the bold detached letters of the pencil 
script characteristic of her latest years. These fascicles contain the 
revised poems, including many which she apparently considered 
finished. During the last three years of my mother's life we went 
through them, while she told me incidents connected with her 
work forty years before. She had copied and edited the contents of 
all the fascicles and numbered them in blue pencil. 

Although Emily seems to have considered many of these poems 
finished, as I have said, they were far from ready for the printer. 
The arrangement, verse form, and in particular the punctuation 
were not clearly indicated. In some poems dashes are sprinkled 
about so lavishly that they give to the page the appearance of a 
thread on which the phrases are strung. At times the dashes seem 
so integral a part of the text that an editor is tempted to 
perpetuate them, lest without them the words should fall apart.

In a good many poems she supplied alternative words, phrases, or 
lines, little crosses indicating where the final choice should be 
inserted. The editor is thus obliged to retrace Emily's steps, to 
follow the method she herself used, trying one word after another 
before deciding which best fits the particular setting. She admits 
that she sometimes approached the choice reluctantly. 

I hesitate which word to take, as I can take but few, and each 
must be the chiefest; but recall that Earth’s most graphic trans¬ 
action is placed within a syllable, nay, even a gaze. 

An editor cannot indulge in the “luxury of doubt." He is forced 
to choose. All this my mother explained in an article written at 
the time of Emily's centenary. 3 


The success of the first volume of poems, published in Novem¬ 
ber, 1890, had been so great that it spurred my mother to in¬ 
creased activity. By midsummer, 1891, all the poems that Emily 
had neatly written on sheets of letter paper had been copied and 
classified “A," “B," and “C." As soon as the manuscript of Poems, 
Second Series, was in the hands of the printer and before proof 
had begun to arrive, my mother made a list of all the poems she 
had copied except those in the two little volumes already pub¬ 
lished. The first lines were entered alphabetically in a small 
leather-covered notebook. In addition to those in the two vol¬ 
umes more than one thousand poems (including sixty-eight not 
listed in the notebook), were soon in shape for the printer. Of 
these, hundreds have not been published until now. 

The 1891 list contains 926 first lines. But this number is only 
approximate because of duplication, as when one stanza from a 
longer poem is listed independently. For this, Emily herself is 
partly responsible. Many poems are easily broken into parts 
which can stand alone. She took advantage of this tact by sending 
to a friend a fragment to fit an occasion. Furthermore, she some¬ 
times used the same stanza in two different poems. “When what 
they sung for is undone," the second stanza of “A pang is more 
conspicuous in spring," is also the beginning of another poem

Magazine , March, 1930.

which trails off into a vague limbo. Such overlapping provides 
plenty of pitfalls for an unwary editor. 

It should be noted that except for the elimination of alterna* 
tives my mother's copies follow Emily's manuscripts exactly, as 
shown by poems of which I have both the original and the copy. 
My mother was scrupulous about this. Any changes from the 
original text, whether of spelling or wording, were made subse¬ 
quently on her own manuscripts and are plainly indicated. This 
makes her copies important, not only because they have correctly 
preserved a good many poems which might otherwise have been 
lost, but for another reason. Since they include the contents of 
Further Poems and Unpublished Poems , volumes brought out 
by Emily's niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the copies serve 
until the originals again become available to check the accuracy 
of the published versions. 

After my mother's death I re-examined the fascicles, comparing 
each poem with her copy of it. In making fresh copies of my own 
I did not always follow her editing, for I ignored her changes 
and sometimes disagreed with her choice of alternatives. My 
effort has always been to discover Emily's own preference. She 
had sometimes underlined one of the alternatives. But if no 
preference was indicated, in most cases I used the word she wrote 
first. In no single instance have I substituted a word or a phrase 
not suggested by Emily herself. Her spelling, on the other hand, 
has been standardized. Certain spellings had special meanings 
for Emily. But the something special evaporates in print. So, 
with great reluctance, I have changed archaic spelling to conform 
to current usage, substituting “dropped," for “dropt," for in¬ 
stance, and “gulf" for “gulph." But I have kept the word “phebe," 
itself a concession, for Emily said she saw it as “fee-bee." 

As I look back upon it, transcription of poems in the fascicles 
seems like child's play in comparison with what was to follow. 
For nearly half of the poems in the present volume had not been 
edited nor, for the most part, even read by my mother. Let me 
explain. 

In addition to the fascicles and some numbered loose sheets 
of letter paper not yet tied together, I found in the camphor- 
wood chest many brown envelopes labeled “E.D., soon to be 



xii BOLTS OF MELODY 

copied,” “Very good odd scraps,” “Copies being made, as yet 
unclassified,” and so on. My mother did not tell me anything 
about the contents of these envelopes except that they contained 
odds and ends which but for a few she had not looked at. She 
always referred to them as “scraps,” not to disparage the poems, 
but to describe the bits of paper on which they were written. 
We did not attempt to decipher them, but laid them aside as 
she had done a generation earlier, and as I for several years 
continued to do. Their appearance was so discouraging that I 
put off grappling with them from year to year, wondering indeed 
as I did so whether I should ever attempt to disentangle them, 
whether the time required would not be wasted. It is only during 
the last three years that I have finally made a systematic exam¬ 
ination of the contents of those envelopes. 

The result has been the discovery of some of Emily's finest 
poetry, because these are the poems she wrote in her fullest 
maturity. They are all in the latest handwriting and all in pencil. 
None of the poems of the final phase of her life were copied by 
her in ink and tied in fascicles. Many of them, though obviously 
first drafts, are nevertheless perfect poems without suggested 
change of a word or a syllable, needing only to be deciphered. 
It is precisely because, during her last years, these thoughts were 
jotted down at white heat and never revised that some of her 
most powerful poems, dealing with fundamental areas of experi¬ 
ence, are contained in this volume. Like the dormant life-germ 
of a plant these verses, buried for sixty years, are at last reaching 
light and air in full vitality. 

But when first discovered they looked impossible—a jumble 
of words on odds and ends of paper, some of it crumpled and 
torn. They were not sorted alphabetically, or according to size, 
or subject matter, or date of composition. Most of them were 
smothered with alternative words and phrases crowded into 
every available space—around the edges, upside down, wedged 
between the lines. Some poems, filling the margins of drafts of 
letters to friends, are difficult to distinguish from the body of 
the letter, following without a break on the same sheet of paper. 
Many are written on the backs of brown-paper bags or of dis¬ 
carded bills, programs, and invitations; on tiny scraps of station-

ery pinned together; on leaves torn from old notebooks (one 
such sheet dated “1824”); on soiled and mildewed subscription 
blanks, or on department- or drug-store bargain flyers from 
Amherst and surrounding towns. There are pink scraps, blue and 
yellow scraps, one of them a wrapper of Chocolat Meunier; 
poems on the reverse of recipes in her own writing, on household 
shopping lists, on the cut-off margins of newspapers, and on the 
inside of their brown-paper wrappings. The poem. 

Oh, give it motion! Deck it sweet 
With artery and vein! 

complete, without suggested change, is on the reverse of a printed 
slip which reads: 

This Lamp, bearing upon the Chimney Gallery and upon the 
Thumbscrew, the name of The German Student Lamp Co., is hereby 
guaranteed to be perfect in all its parts, to burn properly and not 
to leak. 

Should this Lamp not fulfill this Guarantee, another will be 
supplied in its place. 

Emily liked best the inside of used envelopes. Some were 
addressed to herself or Lavinia, or to their parents, the canceled 
stamps still attached; others, addressed to friends, had never been 
posted. Many a detached flap, too, provided just room enough 
for one perfect quatrain. Often the writing is clear and distinct. 
On other scraps it is so confused that it looks as if written in the 
dark—lines overlapping, letters half formed. Indeed, it is some¬ 
times impossible to tell whether such lines constitute a single 
poem, or whether two or more were intended as with “Contained 
in this short life,” here reproduced in facsimile, which might be 
two poems, or two versions of the same poem, or a single poem 
of two stanzas, as on page 265. The sequence of lines, too, is often 
difficult to determine; in some cases even the first line may be 
in doubt. But after laboriously puzzling out a word, a line, a 
stanza, letter by letter, with all the alternatives, one is rewarded 
by seeing, suddenly, a perfect poem burst full-blown into life. 
The clarity of the thought shines forth in striking contrast to 
the chaos of the manuscript. 

Three poems, reproduced in facsimile herewith, make further

BOLTS OF MELODY 


The poems of Emily Dickinson should eventually be arranged 
in the order of composition as well as by subject matter as here¬ 
tofore. Her inner development would thus become apparent— 
the gradual turning from acute personal feeling to emotion 
universal in scope. Toward the last only that concerned her. 
Most rewarding would be a comparison of poems about death— 
the long discursive poems of youth such as “The feet of people 
walking home" and “There is a morn by men unseen”—with the 
terse direct quatrains of the final years, those comprehensive 
generalizations narrowed to four short lines: 

The vastest earthly day 
Is shrunken small 
By one defaulting face 
Behind a pall. 

Some of Emily's latest poems on fame, a rather cool topic, to 
be sure, but one which contrary to common belief nagged her 
incessantly, further illustrate what chronological arrangement 
can reveal. 

Because Emily Dickinson refused to publish, it has been as¬ 
sumed that she did not care for fame. By way of evidence to the 
contrary, poems found among these latest scraps prove that she 
was obsessed by the thought of it. Indeed, she was so conscious 
that she deserved it that she had to keep continually reminding 
herself of its futility—that her own approval was all that mat¬ 
tered. 

Fame of myself to justify! 

All other plaudit be 
Superfluous, an incense 
Beyond necessity. 

Fame of myself to lack, although 
My name be else supreme, 

This were an honor honorless, 

A futile diadem. 

She was aware that among one's contemporaries fame comes 
slowly if at all, and she shielded her poems from their indiffer¬ 
ence. “Too near thou art for fame” is her way of putting it. 

In addition to her published poems on this subject I have 



Introduction 


XXV 


before me fifteen new poems dealing with fame. The earliest of 
these, in the handwriting of the seventies, show a somewhat 
cynical attitude toward the transient quality of what she calls 
“the incident of fame/* 

f ame is the tint that scholars leave 
Upon their setting names, 

The iris not of Occident 
That disappears as comes. 

The frog is a symbol of its evanescence—already a familiar 
thought in “I'm nobody—who are you?" She mentions “his 
eloquence a bubble, as fame should be," but in another poem 
amplifies its true nature: 

A clover’s simple fame 
Remembered of the cow 
Is sweeter than enameled realms 
Of notoriety. 

Renown perceives itself 
And that profanes the flower; 

The daisy that has looked behind 
Has compromised its power. 

She contrasts the desire for fame with achievement worthy of it: 

The beggar at the door for fame 
Were easily supplied, 

But bread is that diviner thing, 

Disclosed to be denied. 

Like happiness, fame cannot be achieved by seeking it: 

To earn it by disdaining it 
Is fame’s consummate fee. 

All this Emily knew very well. And yet the thought of fame 
possessed her. It would not let her go. She questioned whether 
death is indeed its prerequisite. 

The first we knew of him was death, 

The second was renown; 

Except the first had justified. 

The second had not been. 



xxvi BOLTS OF MELODY 

Is the quality of a man’s work really discernible only after he 
is gone? 

All men for honor hardest work. 

But are not known to earn, 

Paid after they have ceased to work 
In infamy or urn. 

That thought is expressed over and over again: 

Above oblivion's tide there is a pier. 

And an effaceless few are lifted there, 

Nay, lift themselves; fame has no arms. 

And but one smile inlaid with balms. 

Once more: 


Fame is the one that does not stay; 

Its occupant must die, 

Or out of sight of estimate 1 

Ascend incessantly. 

Or be that most insolvent thing, 

A lightning in the germ— 

Electrical the embryo 
Or findless is the flame. 

Assuming that her poems must ultimately find an audience, 
Emily declared her faith in the appraisal of posterity in one last 
mighty affirmation: 

The poets light but lamps. 

Themselves go out; 

The wicks they stimulate. 

If vital light 

Inhere, as do the suns. 

Each age a lens 
Disseminating their 
Circumference. 


Not all the poems belong in the body of the book. Part Two 
contains those which are incomplete, fragmentary, or trivial. It is 
as true of them as of all her poems that though Emily attached

XXVll 


importance to form, she had her own rules. Some of her finished 
poems are rough, rugged, awkward. But that she intended. In 
some of these unfinished poems, however, not only is the idea 
obscured by the form; the idea itself is obscure—not sharp 
enough to pierce through the words. It may be questioned 
whether such gropings should be published at all. Many of them 
will undoubtedly not appear in a final edition. But the fact re¬ 
mains that through some of the most confused passages shines a 
thought so searching that it should be preserved whatever the 
setting. 

To select the poems for a definitive edition of the works of 
Emily Dickinson will be easier in fifty years than it is now. At 
present, even the best of critics differ as to which ones should be 
included. In so far as publication is concerned, the day for an 
editorial sieve has passed. The poems should be given an equal 
chance at survival. And so, all unpublished poems and fragments 
of which I have copies are included in this book. All, that is, 
except for a group of about fifty poems hitherto published only 
in part. These must wait for restoration of the omitted portions 
—sometimes amounting to as much as four stanzas—until all of 
Emily's manuscripts are accessible, so that each poem can once 
more be compared with the original and a truly definitive 
edition compiled . 5

On the whole, the impression gained from working with 
Emily's poems through the years is of a lavishness, a fecundity, 
comparable to the prodigality of nature, scattering a thousand 
seeds to insure the survival of one. It is not hard to imagine 
Lavinia Dickinson's consternation when, after her sister’s death, 
she first discovered the manuscripts. 

Emily died leaving no instructions as to what should be done 
with her poems. She did not ask to have them published, nor— 
a fact which should be emphasized—did she ask to have them 
destroyed. Her part in them finished, she recklessly confided her 
life’s work to the cosmos. Was it recklessness, I wonder, or was 
it faith? If the latter, her confidence in their survival would seem 
to have been hardly justified. Lavinia would find them of course. 
But what could she do with them? Her sole qualification for 
custody of so stupendous a treasure was that she worshiped Emily 
with a fierce and jealous loyalty. The poems must be published. 
That Lavinia knew. But how? She made up in resoluteness what 
she lacked in knowledge. 

It is by a lucky chance that in Amherst, at that time a remote 
village, a person should have been at hand who had the necessary 
sensitivity, skill, patience, and capacity for long-sustained hard 
work, as well as the willingness to devote years to the task of 
editing. It is luckier still that the same person should have been 
able to appreciate the grandeur of the poetry, to believe in it 
to such a degree that in spite of its flouting the standards of 
Victorian verse, and against the advice of publisher and critic, 
she nevertheless went ahead, preparing manuscripts for the 
printer, sustained by her own conviction that she was dealing 
with “the greater glory.” It is interesting to speculate as to what 
might have happened to the poems of Emily Dickinson had Mrs. 
Todd not been at hand. 

Given to my mother by Lavinia Dickinson to publish, halted 
on their way to the press by an imbroglio unrelated to literature, 
the poems in this volume are at last released to a public which 
should no longer be denied the right to enjoy them.

PART ONE 




PART ONE 


NOTHING reveals the scope of Emily Dickinson’s insight 
more than the variety of her themes. This I have attempted to 
bring out by the arrangement of the poems in this book. 

The poems in Part One have been grouped in such a way that 
the subject matter progresses toward a climax. First comes the 
world without, nature in its various aspects; the circuit of a day, 
of a year; weather; animals and plants. So great is the renewal of 
spirit gained from nature that Emily could exclaim in some 
surprise, 

I thought that nature was enough 
Till human nature camel 

So next are the Ages of Man: childhood; the awakening of emo¬ 
tion, of romantic love; some poignant stanzas about other 
human beings, and finally meditations on the mystery of death. 
All the foregoing lead up to three groups of philosophical poems 
which open vistas into the significance of life. These culminate 
in “An Ablative Estate,” a section in which more than half of 
the poems, among them the greatest, were written during the 
last years of Emily’s life. 

The poems are arranged under twelve main headings. 

The Far Theatricals of Day 

Dawn, sunrise, noon; the bland quiet of a summer afternoon; 
the marshaling of cloud, the rising wind, the beat of rain; 
lightning, thunder, the "conflict of the upper friends,” sub¬ 
siding at last as "the day fades from the firmament away” into 
slow-moving night—moon, stars, will-o’-the-wisps and all “the 
apparatus of the dark.”

BOLTS OF MELODY 


The Round Year 

“The transient, fragrant snow” of late winter is followed by 
spring, “the period express from God”; “the pomp of summer 
days”; “September's baccalaureate,” harvest time and Indian 
summer; the “early, stooping night” of November and winter with 
“his hoar delights.” 

My Pageantry 

Garden “pageantry” sown in May, “bestowed a summer long,” 
is finally overtaken by “the frost, himself so comely,” which “di¬ 
shevels every prime.” 


Our Little Kinsmen 

Emily contemplates “several of nature's people,” frogs, birds, 
spiders, squirrels, rats, angleworms, and insects—“the most 
important population”—“with modesties enlarged.” 

Once a Child 

Except for a few written in the first person, most of these 
poems in and about childhood deal with small boys. 

The Mob within the Heart 

Many of these poems were written comparatively early in life 
when personal desire loomed large and other people had the 
power to “mangle.” Dealing with personal emotion as it does, 
the section is frankly autobiographical, beginning with the 
quality of childhood loneliness, devotion to girlhood friends, 
disappointment in a too-much-loved woman friend, “bandaged 
moments” and the effort to forget, followed by two or three poems 
on the anatomy of disenchantment. After the passage of time 
comes emancipation from the feeling of loneliness, and with it 
a sense of escape and the exhilaration of discovery that 

The staple must be optional 
That an immortal binds. 

In this release from dependence on “mortal company” Emily 
found the friends who do not fail, and in so doing achieved that

confidence and mellow humor which is in reality a sense of pro¬ 
portion. Her detachment was not completely successful, however, 
for the final poem, a cry of exasperation, is in the very latest 
handwriting. 

Italic Faces 

These poems describe specific persons, some of them historical. 

The Infinite Aurora 

First among these love poems are those written in youth—the 
awakening of romantic love, exultation in it, the torture of 
separation—all with a very special person in mind. After a 
while, Emily is able to dissect the vital experience, to define 
what it is, how it happens. Youthful rhapsodies gradually give 
way to a sense of “the royal infinity/' 

Love is the fellow of the resurrection 
Scooping up the dust and chanting “Livel” 

The White Exploit 

In this section the Ages of Man come full circle. From the 
time when Emily Dickinson first began to write poetry until her 
last fading pencil marks on tattered bits of paper, the mystery of 
death absorbed her. Her poems about death are divided into 
six parts: 

the final inch: These poems deal with the physical fact 
—ways in which a man may die. In early handwriting, 
most of the poems are concerned with a specific individual 
and “the manner of its death.” 

the silver reticence: Here is the expression of per¬ 
sonal feeling aroused by the spectacle of death. Some of 
these poems appear to have been written in its very 
presence—at her mother’s bier. Even Emily’s deepest emo¬ 
tions sought refuge in words. 

repealed from observation: These are meditations on 
the great gulf that separates us from loved ones who have 
“ceased,” and the yearning for an answer from “kindred

as responsive as porcelain/' The final poem in this group 
might well stand as the valedictory of the present crisis in 
human history. 

lids of steel: This is the grave—"the finished feeling” 
experienced when the "lid” has closed upon a friend, 
but somewhat depersonalized in speculation concerning 
the stranger-dead. 

concluded lives: A few poems in this section express 
grief for "the finished creatures departed me,” but on 
the whole they seem strangely detached, written during 
the pause allotted after the death of a friend in which 
"our faith to regulate.” 

creatures clad in miracle: These are they who "go up 
by two and two” to meet the "torrents of eternity.” Begin¬ 
ning with doubt as to the reality of heaven and the inhabit¬ 
ants thereof, the section culminates in a mighty certainty, 
confidence in a time "when questions are not needed for 
answers.” To accentuate Emily's gradual change of attitude 
toward the hereafter I have placed near the end a youthful 
rhapsody, "There is a morn by men unseen,” among 
poems of the latest period. Written in pencil on crumpled 
scraps of paper, these short, late poems bear an affirmation 
as serene and steady as the Psalms. 

Vital Light 

These poems have to do with the nature of inspiration and its 
elusiveness, the "bequest of wings.” It is the "vital light”—in 
beauty, in truth, in poetry, in all creative art. Here is another of 
those great affirmations of Emily's last years compacted in four 
lines: 

Estranged from beauty none can be 
For beauty is infinity. 

And power to be finite ceased 
When fate incorporated us. 

The section concludes with the assurance that when genius is 
frue to jtself, it eventuates in fame. It "cannot escape her.” 



Part One

That Campaign Inscrutable 

Emotion in the abstract is depicted here, the complement of 
similar feelings narrowed to a person in the section entitled The 
Mob within the Heart . But though expressed in generalizations 
the feeling does not lose in intensity. Here are whole areas 
of experience: hope, joy, happiness, gratitude, loneliness, patience, 
and their interrelationships; the role of silence and of escape, 
grief, anguish, and the nature of failure and despair. 

An Ablative Estate 

“The web of life” is here surveyed by an onlooker, by one who 
stands “on the tops of things and like the trees” looks down, 
but who looks through “triple lenses.” The “magical extents” 
of life are explored with a fine detachment, as though from be¬ 
yond a battle fought through. The generalizations are objective 
and impersonal, dealing with such realms as the enticement 
of mystery and the dullness of certainty; the danger of over- 
indulgence in memory “shod with adamant”; also with the nature 
of various ingratiating traits, each summed up in a few words— 
wonder, faith, surprise, suspense, the joy of risk and experiment 
which “escorts us last.” The everlasting anomalies of life are 
somewhat mitigated by the unescapable presence of the soul. In 
bygone years the faith of the Puritans held firm. The final poem 
in Part One summarizes in eight lines the ebbing strength which 
follows loss of faith such as theirs.

You will not wake them up.”

Of opal cattle feeding far 

Upon so vain a hill

But in their stead a sea displayed. 
And ships of such a size 
As crew of mountains could afford 
And decks to seat the skies. 

This too the showman rubbed away. 
And when I looked again, 

Nor farm, nor opal herd was there. 
Nor Mediterranean.

Upheld in rolling air 
By finer gravitations

One joy of so much anguish 
Sweet nature has for me,

With dirks of melody.

Last to adhere when summer swerves away.

He had not on a crown, indeed 
A little palm-leaf hat was all, 

And he was barefoot I'm afraid. 

But sure I am he ermine wore 
Beneath his faded jacket's blue. 
And sure I am the crest he bore 
Within that jacket's pocket too. 

For 'twas too stately for an earl, 

A marquis would not go so grand, 
’Twas possibly a czar petite, 

A pope, or something of that kind! 

If I must tell you, of a horse 
My freckled monarch held the rein. 
Doubtless an estimable beast 
But not at all disposed to run. 

And such a wagon! While I live 
Dare I presume to see 
Another such a vehicle 
As then transported me! 

Two other ragged princes 
His royal state partook, 

Doubtless the first excursion 
These sovereigns ever took. 

I question if the royal coach 
Round which the footmen wait 
Has the significance, on high, 

Of this barefoot estate! 124

So I can hang it in my room 
And make believe I’m getting warm 
When others call it “day”! 

Draw me a robin on a stem, 

So I am hearing him I’ll dream, 

And when the orchards stop their tune 
Put my pretense away. 

Say if it’s really warm at noon, 
Whether it’s buttercups that skim. 

Or butterflies that bloom. 

Then skip the frost upon the lea 
And skip the russet on the tree— 
Let’s play those never come!

Their slippers leaped the town. 
And then I took a pencil 
To note the rebels down; 

And then they grew so jolly 
I did resign the prig, 

And ten of my once stately toes 
Are marshaled for a jig!

The Mob within ihe Heart 




• *75 • 


The mob within the heart 
Police cannot suppress. 

The riot given at the first 
Is authorized as peace. 

Not certified of scene 
Or signified of sound, 

But growing like a hurricane 
In a congenial ground. 


• 176 • 

’Tis true they shut me in the cold. 

But then, themselves were warm 
And could not know the feeling ’twas— 
Forget it. Lord, of them! 

Let not my witness hinder them 
In heavenly esteem. 

No paradise could be conferred 
Through their beloved blame. 

The harm they did was short, and since 
Myself who owe it do, 

Forgive them even as myself. 

Or else forgive not me!

To dine so small as I, 

And yet I was a living child 
With food's necessity

When it has just contained a life 
Then, darling, it will close. 

And yet, so bolder every day, 

So turbulent it grows, 

I'm tempted half to stitch it up 
With a remaining breath 
I should not miss in yielding, though 
To him it would be death. 

And so I bear it big about 
My burial before— 

A life quite ready to depart 
Can harass me no more.

Bestows a single friend—

A solemn thing within the soul 
To feel itself get ripe 
And golden hang, while farther up 
The Maker's ladders stop, 

And in the orchard far below 
You hear a being drop; 

A wonderful, to feel the sun 
Still toiling at the cheek 
You thought was finished; cool of eye. 
And critical of work, 

He shifts the stem a little 
To give your core a look; 

But solemnest to know 
Your chance in harvest moves 
A little nearer; every sun

The lover hovered o'er— 

Unworthy that a thought so mean 
Accost a theme so fair.

"Secrets” is a daily word 
Yet does not exist; 

Muffled, it remits surmise. 
Murmured, it has ceased. 

Dungeoned in the human breast 
Doubtless secrets lie, 

But that grate inviolate 
Comes nor goes away 

Nothing with an ear or tongue; 
Secrets stapled there 
Will decamp but once, and armed. 
To the sepulchre.

Just as he spoke it from his hands 
This edifice remain; 

A turret more, a turret less. 
Dishonor his design . 

According as his skill prefer 
It perish or endure, 

Content soe’er it ornament 
His absent character . 


For one reason or another the poems in Part Two do not belong in 
the body of the book. Some, addressed to special persons, contain a 
name, or a blank where a name should be. Others are occasional bits 
of verse sent with gifts, usually flowers. But most of them are either 
incomplete—words missing, even lines—or unfinished rough drafts. 
Some would be placed with the finished poems except for an anticlimax 
at the end. Among those classified as “unfinished" a few are merely 
obscure. 

There is also a section of short fragments, of which some may be 
alternative stanzas of longer poems, or lines inadvertently separated 
from their context long ago. Some are notes not yet incorporated in 
finished poems although the idea in different words may have been 
used. And there are fragments of yet another sort. Although these 
cannot be classified as poems in the usual sense, consisting of but a line 
or two, they are none the less complete. Length is not of the essence 
of finish. By Chinese standards a couplet such as this might be consid¬ 
ered one of the most perfect poems in the book: 

Soft as the massacre of suns 
By evening’s sabres slain. 

All the fragments except “With thee in the desert/' taken from my 
mother's copy, were found among the “scraps." Few poems in Part Two

The poems in Part Two are arranged in three groups: Poems In¬

which might well be called, in Emily’s words, "Chivalries as Tiny."

The fluttering of her fringes 
Chid my perfidy.

Flees so the phantom meadow 
Before the breathless bee, 

So bubble brooks in deserts 
On ears that dying lie. 

Burn so the evening spires 
To eyes that closing go. 

Hangs so distant heaven 
To a hand below. 14

What shall I do it whimpers so— 

This little hound within the heart— 
All day and night with bark and start. 
And yet it will not go? 

Would you untie it were you me? 
Would it stop whining if to thee 
I sent it, even now? 

It should not tease you, by your chair. 
Or on the mat, or if it dare 
To climb your dizzy knee. 

Or sometimes at your side to run 
When you were willing—shall it come? 
Tell Carlo—he’ll tell me!

If this is “fading/' 

Oh, let me immediately fade! 

If this is “dying,” 

Bury me in such a shroud of red! 

14 A long dash in the fifth line of the manuscript apparently indicates 
space for a name. This poem was written in the sixties, like “All these my 
banners be," p. 45, and on the back of the same sheet. That poem has a 
couplet at the bottom of the page. After this one also there is a short 
stanza, “We lose because we win,” which appears as a separate poem on 
p. *71.

I shall not murmur if at last 
The ones I loved below 
Permission have to understand 
For what I shunned them so— 

Divulging it would rest my heart 
But it would ravage theirs— 
Why, Katie, treason has a voice. 
But mine dispels in tears.

Dying, dying in the night! 

Won't somebody bring the light 
So I can see which way to go 
Into the everlasting snow? 

And Jesus, where is Jesus gone? 

They said that Jesus always came; 
Perhaps he doesn't know the house— 
This way, Jesus! Let him pass! 

Somebody run to the great gate 
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait— 

I hear her feet upon the stair! 

Death won't hurt now Dollie's here!

I often passed the village 
When going home from school. 
And wondered what they did there 
And why it was so still. 

I did not know the year then 
In which my call would come— 
Earlier by the dial 
Than the rest have gone. 

It’s stiller than the sundown. 

It’s cooler than the dawn, 

The daisies dare to come here 
And birds can flutter down. 

So when you are tired, 

Or perplexed, or cold, 

Trust the loving promise 
Underneath the mold. 

Cry “It’s I! Take Dolliel” 

And I will enfold.

I keep my pledge, 

I was not called, 

Death did not notice me. 

I bring my rose, 

I plight again 
By every sainted bee, 

By daisy called from hillside. 
By bobolink from lane, 
Blossom and I— 

Her oath and mine— 

Will surely come again!

If it had no pencil 
Would it try mine— 

Worn, now, and dull, sweet.

Most as big as I was 
When it plucked me? 15

It would not know if it were spurned. 

This gallant little flower.

If one would tamper there!

But may it not despair 
That it is not a cavalier, 

To dare and perish there?

Of Brussels it was not; 

Of Kidderminster? Nay, 

The winds did buy it of the woods. 
They sold it unto me. 

It was a gentle price 
The poorest could afford; 

It was within the frugal purse 
Of beggar or of bird. 

Of small and spicy yards, 

In hue a mellow dun, 

Of sunshine and of sere composed, 
But princip’ly of sun. 

The wind unrolled it fast. 

And spread it on the ground— 
Upholst’rer of the pines is he, 
Upholst’rer of the pond.

Where daffodils abide.

If I should cease to bring a rose 
Upon a festal day,

I have been called away . 

If I should cease to take the names 
My buds commemorate,

Clasps my murmuring lip . 17

Because my brook is fluent 

Because that you are going 

Because the bee may blameless hum

Bloom is result. To meet a flower

Shells from the coast mistaking 119 

Sift her from brow to bare foot 168

Snow, beneath whose chilly softness 205

So has a daisy vanished 195 

So I pull my stockings off 88 

So large my will 107
