“Charlie had said that key elements of my building’s design…would be determined by this _first fact_.” [italics mine] (Pollan 31)

“[T]here were views to consider (from the building, of the building), the fall of light across its floor, the movement of air around it, the ambient sounds, the angle at which it met the late-day sun.” (31)

“Dwell too long on so many soon-to-be-set-in-stone characteristics and the decisions is liable to paralyze you.” (31)

**“I felt that by choosing its site – a single place out of all possible places in which to build – I was setting this great big contingency in motion, rolling it down the steep, one-way hill of personal and local history.” (31)**
