      

1.  Summarizes what data quality has been defined as in fields outside of literary studies
2.  Discusses the possibilities of how it can be defined for literary studies
3.  Demonstrates one example of that through
	1.  The production of a data set of Emily Dickinson’s poems via several available digital and non-digital manuscripts and
	2.  Data quality metrics that parametrize and form as a whole the proposed notion of quality for Dickinson’s poems
	3.  The running of several models based on different stage Dickinson amalgam data sets of varying quality as set out by those metrics – all leading to the notion of a final amalgam data set of the highest quality and model that most utilizes that comprehensive data quality metric set
4.  The last step leads into the notion of the second chapter: model quality (ideal model for a data set and the fine tuning of parameters for the best demonstration of the analytical goal for that model)
