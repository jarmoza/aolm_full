reading text as data

 - find close matches
   - to csv
 - select and investigate close matches
   - compare poems themselves
 - select highly mismatched poems for close reading
   - take a few examples and highlight linguistic areas of mismatch
     - locate patterns within the linguistic mismatch
     - expand outward to entire collection to look for that pattern first located at small scale
