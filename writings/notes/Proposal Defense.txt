riddle of literary quality - hyguens
the stability of reception

questions of data quality

ryan heuser - work on 18th century (dirty data)

questions of how much does n trend change across different repos/data sets
  - ground truth vs cases when not

canonicity measure - is actually external, reviews/syllabi
Ted has a dataset
Stanford Litlab also

but could be measured as internal - how many copies

Recommendations

A lot of process/status documentation
