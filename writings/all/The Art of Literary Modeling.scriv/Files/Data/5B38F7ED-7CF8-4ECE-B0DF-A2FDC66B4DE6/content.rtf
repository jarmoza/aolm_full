Those reading this may be forgiven for the assumption that my title\'92s term \'91literary\'92 necessarily refers to the qualities of the works that are modeled in the following pages. While the term itself is already loaded with meanings (as well as connotations both positive and negative), I wish to encumber it with another definition. The subject of this work is the modeling of humanities\'92 data (more on that in the first chapter), and thus the models will be created with the intent of harboring the goals of humanities scholarship. Those goals vary from field to field and even individual to individual, but, as we will see, humanities data modeling infers some other qualities not typically considered in more historically mathematical fields of study. A \'93literary model\'94 is therefore something imbued with a high quality, but not necessarily one just of statistical rigor. Rather, just as \'93literary\'94 can refer to the values both within a work and the external forces that elevate that work to a high status, so too will that extend to a humanities model of cultural objects  \'96 in this case of text and images. A \'93literary model\'94 is still a model that quantifies and reduces in representation of its underlying objects, but it is more aesthetically rich, and one that is more sound because of that richness.}
