\f0\fs26 \cf0 - Wrote a function to calculate dq metrics for the ur edition (MTPO). You can only calculate so many of them however because many dq metrics depend on comparing to other editins (intra-collection, i.e. metadata suffiency) or against an ur edition (extra-collection, i.e. text records to control records). In that case, the dq metric value is 100% (or 1.0). However, metrics that are compared against sources outside of both the ur edition and compared collections can be done (i.e. lexical validity)\
- It\'92s not clear how useful it is to calculate the dq metrics for an ur edition, but it could possibly give a rough idea of generic measurements of quality of the edition. These can be used in comparison to the dq metric values for compared editions}
