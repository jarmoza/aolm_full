\f0\b\fs26 \cf0 Why data quality matters for humanists?
\f1\b0 \
\
Computer scientists (etc.) will be creating models of what we refer to as literature (a.k.a. Humanities data) so that chatbots/LLMs can summarize and interpret that for the public in search of information about it. What is the role of humanities in this future? There are several, but one of them will be to work on defining and sustaining high quality versions of datasets for such models. While it\'92s true that statistically sometimes errata in a transcription or errata from a particular edition might not matter, as humanists know small changes often make differences in things like summaries and interpretations.\
Furthermore, if humanities scholars wish to produce research based on computational models of their textual subjects they too will want to have a well-defined quality standards for those subjects so that their own, more traditional research findings have sound bases}
